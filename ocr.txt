INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 

To the Board of Directors and the Board of Governors of Black Sea Trade and Development Bank 

Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements 

Opinion 

We have audited the financial statements of Black Sea Trade and Development Bank (the Bank), which 
comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2021 and the statements of income and 
comprehensive  income,  changes  in  equity  and  cash  flows  for  the  year  then  ended,  and  notes  to  the 
financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of Black Sea Trade and Development Bank as at 31 December 2021, and its financial performance 
and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs). 

Basis for Opinion 

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as these have been 
incorporated into Greek legislation.  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 
“Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements” section of our report.  We have been 
independent of the Bank during the whole period of our appointment in accordance with the International 
Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) as 
incorporated  into  Greek  legislation  and  the  ethical  requirements  in  Greece  relevant  to  the  audit  of  the 
financial  statements  and  we  have  fulfilled  our  ethical  requirements  in  accordance  with  the  applicable 
legislation and the above mentioned Code of Ethics.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 

Emphasis of Matter 

We draw your attention to note 28 of the financial statements where it is described the negative impact of 
the geopolitical turmoil in Ukraine and Russia, that begun in February 2022, on the quality of some of the 
Bank’s assets. 

Our report is not qualified in respect to this matter. 

Key Audit Matters 

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our 
audit of the financial statements of the current year.  These matters  and the assessed risks of material 
misstatements were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in 
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Key audit matter 
Expected Credit Loss on Loans at amortized cost 
Loans at amortized cost of the Bank amounted 
to EUR 2,329 million as at 31 December 2021 
(EUR 2,030 million as at 31 December 2020) 
and loss impairment to EUR 44 million (EUR 56 
million as at 31 December 2020) as presented 
on the Statement of Financial Position. 

How the matter was addressed in our audit 

Based on our risk assessment and following a risk 
based approach, we have evaluated the impairment 
methodologies applied and assumptions made by 
Management in relation to this key audit matter, 
which included, inter alia, the following audit 
procedures: 

Τhe Bank measures Expected Credit Losses 
(ECL) for loans at amortized cost both on an 
individual and a collective basis. 

The estimation of ECL on loans at amortized 
cost is considered a key audit matter as it is a 
complex calculation that involves the use of a 
number of assumptions and parameters such as 
probability of default (PD), Loss Given Default 
(LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) as well as 
assumptions around the inputs used and 
probability weight of the multiple economic 
scenarios.   

Significant Management judgements also 
relates to the criteria used for the staging 
assessment of loans at amortized cost. 

Management provided further information about 
principles and accounting policies for 
determining the allowance for impairment on 
loans at amortized cost and the management of 
credit risk in notes 3.6, 5, 12 and 15 to the 
financial statements. 

-  we obtained an understanding of the 

procedures and evaluated the design and 
implementation of relevant internal controls 
within the business process. 

-  we assessed the appropriateness of the 

Bank’s IFRS 9 impairment methodologies. 

-  with the support of our internal financial risk 
modeling specialists we assessed the 
reasonableness of Management’s 
assumptions and input data used in the 
model, including the analysis of the 
forecasted macroeconomic variables.  We 
tested the mechanical elements of the 
calculations such as the EAD, the PD and 
stage allocation and reperformed the 
calculation of the ECL on a sample basis. 
-  we tested the accuracy and completeness 
of critical data used in the ECL calculation 
by agreeing a sample of ECL calculation 
data points to source systems or 
documentation. 
on a sample basis we assessed the 
reasonableness of the estimated expected 
credit loss for the individually assessed 
credit impaired exposures. 

- 

We assessed the adequacy and completeness of 
the Bank’s disclosures in respect of credit risk, 
structure and quality of loan portfolio and 
impairment allowance in accordance with IFRS 9. 

Other Information  

Management  is  responsible  for  the  other  information.    The  other  information  comprises  the  information 
included in the Annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.   

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any 
form of assurance conclusion thereon. 

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
and,  in  doing  so,  consider  whether  the  other  information  is  materially  inconsistent  with  the  financial 
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, 
based on the work we  have performed,  we conclude  that there  is a material  misstatement  in this other 
information, we are required to report that fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements 

Management  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  in 
accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable 
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. 

In  preparing  the  financial  statements,  Management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Bank’s  ability  to 
continue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and  using  the 
going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease 
operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. 

The Audit Committee of the Bank is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process. 

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes 
our  opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs, as these have been incorporated into Greek legislation, will always 
detect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists.    Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. 

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, as these have been incorporated into Greek legislation, we 
exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and  perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit 
evidence  that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.    The  risk  of  not 
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, 
as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override 
of internal control. 

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Bank's internal control. 

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates and related disclosures made by Management. 

Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting 
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events 
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern.  
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s 
report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date 
of  our  auditor’s  report.    However,  future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Bank  to  cease  to 
continue as a going concern. 

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the 
disclosures,  and  whether  the  financial  statements  represent  the  underlying  transactions  and 
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope 
and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control 
that we identify during our audit. 

We  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with  a  statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant 
ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters  that  may  reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our  independence,  and  where  applicable,  related 
safeguards. 

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that 
were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the 
key audit matters.

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

2.1 

Basis of Preparation 

The  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 

These financial statements for the year ended 2021 were submitted by the Management Committee to the 
Board of Directors (BoD) for approval on 6 June 2022 and were approved for issuance on that date. 

Pursuant  to  Article  23  of  the  Establishing  Agreement,  these  financial  statements  shall  be  subject  to 
approval by the Board of Governors (BoG) in their Annual Meeting to be held on 23 June 2022. 

Basis of measurement 

The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the below assets 
and liabilities which have been measured at fair value: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

Debt investment securities at fair value through other comprehensive income; 
Loans at fair value through profit or loss; 
Equity investments at fair value through profit or loss; 
Equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income; 
Derivative financial instruments; and 
Plan assets. 

Functional and presentation currency 

The Bank’s functional currency is the Euro (EUR) as defined by the European Central Bank (ECB). 
The  Euro  is  most  representative  of  the  Bank’s  operations  and  environment  as  a  significant 
percentage  of  the  Bank’s  lending  operations  are  in  Euro,  and  the  administrative  expenses  and 
capital  expenditures  are  primarily  denominated  and  settled  in  this  currency.  The  Bank’s 
presentation  currency  is  the  EUR  and  values  are  rounded  to  the  nearest  thousand  unless 
otherwise stated. 

Use of Estimates and Judgments  

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make 
judgments  and  use  of  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  application  of  the  accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and 
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those reported. Estimates and 
underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized 
prospectively. 

12 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notes to the Financial Statements 

The  areas  where  the  Bank  has  applied  judgement  and  used  estimates  and  assumptions  are: 
estimation of expected credit losses of loans, fair valuation of financial instruments not quoted in 
active markets, including OTC derivatives and certain debt securities, impairment of investment 
securities, estimation of retirement benefits obligation, and contingencies from litigation. 

The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or areas where assumptions and estimates are 
significant to the financial statements are disclosed in the Note 4. 

2.2 

Going Concern 

The Bank’s Board of Governors considered the Bank’s ongoing financial sustainability when approving the 
Bank’s  “Long  Term  Strategic  Framework  (LTSF)  2021-2030”  in  June  2021,  which  reflects  the  Bank’s 
prospects and the ways in which its shareholders would like it to evolve. 

Further  and  in  support  of  the  new  LTSF,  the  Board  of  Governors  has  approved  an  increase  to  the 
subscribed capital of the Bank, to take place over the period 2023-2030. 

The financial statements for 2021 have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Bank’s capital and 
liquidity position were confirmed by the Board of Directors on 6 June 2022, the date on which the financial 
statements were approved. 

In  the  context  of  formulation  and  approval  of  the  next  Medium-term  Strategy  and  Business  Plan  2023-
2026, the Board of Governors will provide in the second half of the year the necessary guidance and in this 
context  will  recommend  adjustments  to  the  LTSF  2021-2030  to  the  extent  to  which  it  will  be  deemed 
appropriate.

3. 

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

A summary of the Bank’s accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are 
presented  in  this  section.  These  policies  are  the  same  as  those  applied  for  the  comparative  period 
presented  taking  into  account  the  amendments  to  standards  which  were  issued  by  the  International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which are further analyzed below: 

3.1 

Adoption of New and Amended Standards (IFRS) 

New  standards  and  amendments  to  standards  which  were  issued  by  the  International  Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB), applied on 1 January 2021: 

• 

IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements 

IAS  1 sets  out the  overall  requirements for financial  statements,  including  how  they should  be 
structured, the  minimum  requirements  for  their content  and  overriding concepts such  as  going 
concern, the  accrual  basis  of  accounting  and  the current/non-current  distinction.  The standard 
requires a complete set of financial statements to comprise a statement of financial positio n, a 
statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other comprehensive  income,  a statement of changes in  equity 
and  a  statement  of  cash  flows.  Effective  1  January  2011,  earlier  application  is  permitted.  The 
amendments  are  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1  January  2023.  Earlier 
application is permitted. The adoption is not expected to have any material impact on the Bank’s 
financial statements. 

• 

IAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors 

IAS 8 is applied in selecting and applying accounting policies, accounting for changes in estimates 
and  reflecting  corrections  of  prior  period  errors.  The  standard  requires  compliance  with  any 
specific IFRS applying to a transaction, event or condition, and provides guidance on developing 
accounting  policies  for  other  items  that  result  in  relevant  and  reliable  information.  Changes  in 
accounting policies and corrections of errors are generally retrospectively accounted for, whereas 
changes in accounting estimates are generally  accounted for on a prospective basis. Effective 
1January 2011, earlier application is permitted. The amendments are effective for annual periods 
beginning  on  or  after  1  January  2023.  Earlier  application  is  permitted.  The  adoption  is  not 
expected to have any material impact on the Bank’s financial statements. 

• 

IAS 12: Income Taxes 

IAS 12 implements a so-called 'comprehensive balance sheet method' of accounting for income 
taxes which recognizes both the current tax consequences of transactions and  events and the 
future tax consequences of the future recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of an entity's 
assets  and  liabilities.  Differences  between  the  carrying  amount  and  tax  base  of  assets  and 
liabilities, and carried forward tax losses and credits, are recognized, with limited exceptions, as 
deferred  tax  liabilities  or  deferred  tax  assets,  with  the  latter  also  being  subject  to  a  'probable 
profits'  test.  First  effective  as  Canadian  GAAP  under  Part  I  for  interim  and  annual  financial 
statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after  1 January 2011. The amendments are 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. Earlier application is permitted. 
The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. 
Early  adoption  is  permitted.  The  adoption  will  not  have  any  impact  on  the  Bank’s  financial 
statements. 

• 

IAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment 

IAS  16  outlines  the  accounting  treatment  for  most  types  of  property,  plant  and  equipment. 
Property,  plant  and  equipment  is  initially  measured  at  its  cost,  subsequently  measured  either 
using a cost or revaluation model, and depreciated so that its depreciable amount is allocated on 
a systematic basis over its useful life.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after 
1 January 2011, earlier application is permitted. The amendments are effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Early application is permitted. The adoption is not expected 
to have any material impact on the Bank’s financial statements. 

• 

IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets 

IAS 37 outlines the accounting for provisions (liabilities of uncertain timing or amount), together 
with  contingent  assets  (possible  assets)  and  contingent  liabilities  (possible  obligations  and 
present  obligations  that  are  not  probable  or  not  reliably  measurable).  Effective  for  interim  and 
annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after  1 January 2011, earlier 
application is permitted. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2022. Early application is permitted. The adoption is not expected to have any material 
impact on the Bank’s financial statements. 

• 

IAS 41: Agriculture 

IAS 41 sets out the accounting for  agricultural activity  – the transformation of biological assets 
(living plants and animals) into agricultural produce (harvested product of the entity's biological 
assets). The standard generally requires biological assets to be measured at fair value less costs 
to sell. Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on 
or after 1 January 2011, earlier application is permitted. The amendments are effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Early application is permitted. The adoption will not 
have any impact on the Bank’s financial statements. 

• 

IFRS 1: First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards 

IFRS 1 sets out the procedures that an entity must follow when it adopts IFRS for the first time as 
the  basis  for  preparing  its  general  purpose  financial  statements.  The  IFRS  grants  limited 
exemptions from the general requirement to comply with each IFRS effective at the end of its first 
IFRS reporting period. Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years 
beginning  on  or  after  1  January  2011,  earlier  application  is  permitted.  The  amendments  are 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Early application is permitte d. 
The adoption will not have any impact on the Bank’s financial statements. 

• 

IFRS 3: Business Combinations 

IFRS 3 outlines the accounting when an acquirer obtains control of a business (e.g. an acquisition 
or merger). Such business combinations are accounted for using the 'acquisition method', which 
generally requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their fair values at 
the acquisition date. Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years 
beginning  on  or  after  1  January  2011,  earlier  application  is  permitted.  The  amendments  are 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Early application is permitted if 
an  entity  also  applies  all  other  updated  references  (published  together  with  the  updated 
Conceptual Framework) at the same time or earlier. The adoption is not expected to have any 
material impact on the Bank’s financial statements. 

• 

IFRS 17: Insurance Contracts 

IFRS 17 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure 
of insurance contracts within the scope of the standard. The objective of IFRS 17 is to ensure that 
an entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents those contracts. This information 
gives a basis for users of financial statements to assess the effect that insurance contracts have 
on  the  entity's  financial  position,  financial  performance  and  cash  flows.  The  IASB  tentatively 
decided to defer the effective date of IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts to annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2022 [The IASB has also published 'Extension of the Temporary Exemption 
from Applying IFRS 9 (Amendments to IFRS 4)' to defer the fixed expiry date of the amendment 
also to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023]. The adoption is not expected to have 
any material impact on the Bank’s financial statements.

3.2 

Foreign Currencies Translation 

Foreign currency transactions are initially recorded in EUR by applying to the foreign currency amount the 
exchange rate between the EUR and the foreign currency at the rate prevailing at the date of transaction. 

When  preparing  the  financial  statements  exchange  gains  and  losses  arising  from  the  translation  of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end are recognized in the income 
statement. 

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Euro at the exchange 
rate at the reporting date. The foreign exchange gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between 
the amortized cost in Euro at the beginning of the year, adjusted for the effective interest, impairment and 
prepayments during the year, and the amortized cost in the foreign currency translated at the exchange 
rate at the end of the year. 

Non-monetary  items  that  are  measured  at  historical  cost  in  a  foreign  currency  are  translated  using  the 
exchange  rate  at  the  date  of  the  transaction.  Foreign  currency  differences  are  generally  recognized  in 
income statement except for foreign exchange differences on non-monetary items which are at FVTOCI 
as equity investments which are recognized in other comprehensive income. 

The Bank uses the official exchange rates published for the EUR by the European Central Bank (ECB). 
The exchange rates used by the Bank at the financial position date were as follows.

For  the  purposes  of  the  statement  of  cash  flows,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  on  hand, 
placements with other financial institutions and debt securities with maturities of three months or less from 
the financial position date. These are highly liquid assets that are readily convertible to a known amount of 
cash and are subject to insignificant risk of change in value due to the movements in market rates. 

3.4 

Recognition and Initial Measurement, and Derecognition of Financial Instruments 

The  Bank  recognizes  a  financial  asset  or  financial  liability  in  its  statement  of  financial  position  when  it 
becomes a party to the contractual rights or obligations. 

3.4.1  Date of recognition 

Financial  assets  and  liabilities,  with  the  exception  of  loans  and  advances  to  customers  and 
balances due to customers, are initially recognized on the trade date, i.e., the date on  which the 
Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. This includes regular way 
trades, i.e., purchase or sale of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame 
generally  established  by  regulation  or  convention  in  the  market  place.  Loans  and  advances  to 
customers are recognized when funds are transferred to the customer’s account. 

Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at 
Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its 
acquisition  or  issue.  The  fair  value  of  a  financial  instrument  at  initial  recognition  is  generally  its 
transaction price.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

3.4.2  Date of derecognition 

The Bank derecognizes a financial asset or a portion of a financial asset when (i) the contractual 
rights to the cash flow from the financial asset expire, (ii) loses control of the contractual rights that 
comprise the financial asset or a portion of the financial asset or (i) the Bank retains the right to 
receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed the obligation to pay it in full without material 
delay  to  a  third  party  under  a  ‘pass  through’  arrangement.  The  Bank  derecognizes  a  financial 
liability  when  a  liability  is  extinguished,  that  is  when  the  obligation  specified  in  the  contract  is 
discharged, cancelled or expires. The evaluation of the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership 
precedes the evaluation of the transfer of control for derecognition transactions. 

On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or 
the  carrying  amount  allocated  to  the  portion  of  the  asset  derecognized)  and  the  sum  of  (i)  the 
consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) 
any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in income statement. 

Any cumulative gain or loss recognized in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated 
as  at  Fair  Value  through  Other  Comprehensive  Income  (FVTOCI)  is  not  recognized  in  income 
statement on derecognition of such securities.  

3.5 

Financial Assets 

The  classification  of  financial  assets  defines  how  existing  information  is  reflected  in  the  financial 
statements.  In  particular,  the  valuation  method  and  the  impairment  calculation  are  defined  by  this 
classification, which are based on criteria established by the Bank.  

3.5.1  Classification and subsequent measurement 

The  Bank  classifies  a  financial  asset  in  its  financial  statements  in  one  of  the  below  three 
measurement categories: 

1. 

2. 

Financial assets measured at amortized cost (AC): this category includes each asset or 
group of assets for which the Bank's business model constitutes its holding for the purpose 
of collecting contractual cash flows. Financial assets are classified at AC only if both of the 
following criteria are met: 
- 

The objective of the Bank’s business model is to hold financial assets in order to 
collect the contractual cash flows; and 
The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash 
flows  that  are  solely  payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  principal 
outstanding: 

- 

The Bank includes in this category financial assets which are non-derivative with fixed or 
determinable  payments  and  with  fixed  maturities  meeting  the  above  criteria.  They  are 
initially recognized at fair value plus any transaction costs and including any premium or 
discount that may  arise on the date of acquisition.  Third  party expenses, such as legal 
fees, incurred in securing a loan are treated as part of the cost of the transaction. They are 
subsequently measured at AC using the effective interest method, less any allowance for 
expected credit losses. All such financial assets are recognized on settlement date. 

These financial assets include cash and due from banks, loans and receivables accrued 
that meet the above criteria. 

Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), 
with  gains  or  losses  reclassified  on  profit  or  loss  on  derecognition.  The  Bank  classifies 
debt instruments (including euro commercial paper (ECP)) at FVTOCI when  both of the 
following conditions are met: 
- 

The instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved 
by both collecting the contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and 
The contractual terms give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely 
payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. 

- 

17 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notes to the Financial Statements 

FVTOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses 
that arise from fluctuations in fair value recognized in OCI. Their fair value is determined 
by  reference  to  quoted  market  bid  prices.  On  derecognition  cumulative  gain  or  loss 
previously  recognized  in  OCI  are  reclassified  from  OCI  to  income  statement.  Foreign 
exchange gains or losses and interest income calculated using the effective interest rate 
method are recognized in income statement. 

All such financial assets are recognized on trade date. 

The Expected Credit Losses (ECL) for debt instruments measured at FVOCI do not reduce 
the carrying amount of these financial assets in the statement of financial position, which 
remains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the 
assets  were  measured  at  amortized  cost  is  recognized  in  OCI  as  an  accumulated 
impairment amount, with a corresponding charge to the profit or loss. The accumulated 
loss recognized in OCI is recycled to the profit and loss upon derecognition of the assets. 

3. 

Financial  assets  (equity  instruments)  measured  at  FVTOCI,  with  no  reclassification  of 
gains or losses to profit or loss on derecognition. On initial recognition the Bank can make 
the irrevocable election, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, to designate investments 
in  an  equity  instrument  which  are  not  held  for  trading  nor  contingent  consideration 
recognized by an acquirer  in a business combination, as a financial  asset measured at 
FVTOCI.  Those  not  elected,  which  are  primarily  listed,  are  measured  at  Fair  Value 
Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL). Dividends received are recorded in the income statement. 

After initial recognition at cost, these financial assets are subsequently measured at fair 
value with all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value (realized and unrealized), 
including foreign exchange gains and losses, recognized in other comprehensive income, 
and are not reclassified to income statement. For those financial instruments there is no 
impairment assessment. The fair value for those not purchased from an active market is 
determined using accepted valuation techniques which use unobservable inputs. These 
valuation techniques used are net asset value, when this is deemed to approximate fair 
value, and earnings-based valuations using comparable information and discounting cash 
flows.  The  Bank’s  equity  investments  are  included  in  this  category.  All  such  financial 
assets are recognized on settlement date. 

4. 

Financial assets measured at FVTPL: this category includes financial assets that do not 
meet the criteria to be classified in any of the above categories as well as financial assets 
that the Bank holds for trading.  Their classification depends primarily on the following two 
important factors (i) the Bank’s business model for these assets and (ii) the characteristics 
of the contractual cash flows of the asset. 

These financial assets are initially measured at their fair value and subsequently carried 
at fair value on the statement of financial position with all changes in fair value gains and 
losses and foreign exchange gains and losses, recognized in the income statement in the 
period in which they occur. Transaction costs on these financial assets are expensed in 
the  income  statement.  This  category  includes  derivative  financial  instruments,  equity 
securities as well as any loans for which either of the criteria for recognition at AC is not 
met.  It can also  include a  debt instrument or  an equity instrument that  is not within the 
category nor measured at FVTOCI. All such financial assets are recognized on trade date. 

In  addition,  a  debt  instrument  that  could  meet  AC  criteria  can  be  designated  at  initial 
recognition as at FVTPL.  This classification option, which is irrevocable, is used when the 
designation  eliminates  a  measurement  or  recognition  inconsistency,  referred  to  as  an 
‘accounting mismatch’, which would arise from measuring  financial assets and liabilities 
on a different basis in relation to another financial asset or liability. 

As at the reporting date the Bank has not designated, at initial recognition, any financial 
asset as at FVTPL.

3.5.2  Measurement 

The Bank measures financial assets at fair value on initial recognition, as detailed above. In the 
event the Bank considers that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price, 
that difference is recognized as a gain or loss on initial recognition but only if the fair value is based 
on a requested active market price for identical assets or is based on a valuation technique using 
data solely from identified markets. In all other cases, the difference between the transaction price 
and  the  fair  value  is  deferred  and  is  only  recognized  in  the  income  statement  when  the  inputs 
become observable, or when the instrument is derecognized. 

Financial assets that are subsequently measured at either AC or debt instruments at FVTOCI, are 
subject to provisions for impairment. 

Based on the Bank's credit policy, the Bank does not originate credit-impaired financial assets, nor 
does the Bank purchase credit-impaired assets, exception being those loans would be acquired at 
a deep discount. 

Financial  assets  are  not  reclassified  subsequent  to  their  initial  recognition,  except  in  the  period 
after the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets. 

3.5.3  Business model assessment 

The factor of the business model refers, amongst others, to the manner in which the Bank manages 
its financial assets by classifying them in portfolios that are part of its business model. The adopted 
business  model  determines  the  source  of  revenue,  as  it  arises  from  individual  portfolios  either 
through  the  collection  of  contractual  cash  flows  or  from  the  sale  of  financial  assets  or  the 
combination of the above. 

The  assessment  of  the  business  model  reflects  the  Bank's  strategy  under  normal  business 
conditions.  The  assessment  is  not  affected  by  actions  required  in  ‘emergency  situations’  (e.g.: 
liquidity needs, non-inherent capital requirements for credit risk, etc.). Also, Management decisions 
taken to comply with new regulatory guidelines are not included in the assessment. 

In general, the Bank has included the majority of its loan portfolios in the hold-to-collect business 
model. The assessment of a business model is made within the definition of operational objectives 
as defined by the Bank's Management, as well as in the operational management of its assets. 
The assessment is effected at portfolio level rather than at individual asset levels. 

The Business Model applied to loan portfolio, treasury portfolio and equity investment portfolio is 
reassessed  at  each  reporting  period.  The  reassessment  of  the  Business  Model  has  been 
established in order to determine if evidence initially used has changed. The assessment process 
applied by the Bank through its business model, based on strategic objectives, classifies its assets 
in the following three categories in accordance with IFRS 9: 

i) 

Hold to collect 

Each asset or group of assets for which the Bank's business model recommends that it be held for 
the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows is classified as ‘Hold to collect’. 

ii) 

Hold to collect and sell 

Each asset or group of assets for which the Bank's business model recommends that it be held for 
the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows and selling them when the strategic planning of 
their acquisition has been achieved is classified as ‘Hold to collect and sell’. 

iii) 

Trading portfolio 

The financial assets held for trading are classified as ‘Trading portfolio’. The Bank had no financial 
assets in trading portfolio.

3.5.4  Loans 

Loans  originated  by  the  Bank,  is  where  money  is  provided  directly  to  the  borrower.  Loans  are 
initially  recorded  at  fair  value,  which  is  usually  the  net  amount  disbursed  at  inception  including 
directly  attributable  origination  costs  and  certain  types  of  fees  or  commission  (e.g.  syndication 
commission,  front-end,  commitment  fees  and  handling  charges)  that  are  regarded  as  an 
adjustment to the effective interest rate of the loan, and are subsequently measured at amortized 
cost using the effective interest rate method. 

The Bank classifies in  loan category bonds which are purchased with a view of a development 
impact and such purchases are performed based on the Bank’s loan financing criteria and follow 
the thorough appraisal and approval process of the Bank. Such bonds at 31 December 2021 were 
a  gross  amount  of  EUR  294,330  thousand  (2020:  EUR  267,588  thousand).  Management  has 
concluded that presentation within loans present fairly the Bank’s financial position. 

Loans that are designated as at FVTPL are recognized at a value arrived at by using a combination 
of discounted cash flow models. These models incorporate market data pertaining to interest rates, 
a borrower’s credit rating, and underlying assets. Where unobservable inputs have been used, a 
sensitivity  analysis  has  been  included  under  ‘fair  value  hierarchy’  described  within  the  ‘Risk 
Management’ section of this report. 

3.6 

Impairment 

3.6.1  Financial assets 

The Bank records an allowance for expected credit loss for all loans and loans receivables, and 
other  debt  instruments  held  at  amortized  cost,  together  with  off  balance  sheet  items  (loan 
commitments  and  financial  guarantee  contracts).  In  this  section,  all  referred  to  as  ‘financial 
instruments’. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IFRS 9. 

i) 

Calculation of expected credit loss 

ECLs are a probability-weighted average estimate of credit losses that reflects the time value of 
money. Upon initial recognition of the financial instruments in scope of the impairment policy, the 
Bank  records  a  loss  allowance  equal  to  12-month  ECL,  being  the  ECL  that  result  from  default 
events  that  are  possible  within  the  next  twelve  months.  Subsequently,  for  those  financial 
instruments  that  have  experienced  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  (SICR)  since  initial 
recognition, a loss allowance equal to lifetime ECL is recognized, arising from default events that 
are possible over the expected life of the instrument. The expected credit losses are weighted on 
the basis of three macroeconomic scenarios (adverse, basic and favorable). 

For the purposes of calculating expected credit losses, the financial instruments are classified in 
three stages as follows:  

• 

• 

• 

Stage 1: Stage 1 includes performing exposures that do not have significant increase in 
credit risk since initial recognition. Stage 1 also includes exposures for which credit risk 
has been  improved  and the exposure has  been reclassified from  Stages  2 or  3. In this 
stage expected credit losses are recognized based on the probability of default within the 
next 12 months. 

Stage 2: Stage  2 includes  performing  exposures for which there  has been  a significant 
increase in credit risk since initial recognition. Stage 2 also includes exposures for which 
the credit risk has improved, and the exposure has been reclassified from stage 3. In this 
stage, lifetime expected credit losses are recognized. 

Stage 3: Stage 3 includes non-performing / credit-impaired exposures. In this stage lifetime 
expected credit losses are recognized. 

20 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Notes to the Financial Statements 

The Bank calculates impairment losses on a portfolio basis, except for financial assets that are 
credit-impaired in which case they are calculated on an individual basis. The Bank applies three 
main components to measure expected credit losses which are a LGD, PD and EAD, and assigns 
general market scenarios for potential credit risk deterioration. There can be transfers of exposures 
from  one  stage  to  another,  depending  on  whether  there  is  a  change  in  the  credit  risk  of  that 
exposure. Probability of default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. 

The Bank uses information obtained from the Global Emerging Markets (GEMs) database in order 
to assign LGD to its loan asset classes. GEMs is an International Financial Institution (IFI) wide 
initiative  designed to pool  default and recovery rates  experienced  by IFIs  in  emerging markets. 
Treasury asset classes derive their PDs from the assigning rating agency. LGD is an estimate of 
the loss arising on default. The Bank uses information obtained from the GEMs database to assign 
LGDs to its lending asset classes, and treasury asset classes derive their LGDs from the assigning 
rating agency. 

ii) 

Basic parameters used for the calculation of expected credit loss  

The calculation of expected credit losses is based on the following parameters:  

• 

• 

• 

Probability of Default (PD) represents the probability that a debtor will default on his debt 
obligations either over the next twelve months or over the remaining maturity of his debt. 
In accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank uses non-discriminatory point-in-time PDs that adjust 
to macroeconomic assumptions using the Expected Credit Loss. 

Exposure at Default (EAD) is defined as the estimate of the exposure at a future default 
date,  taking  into  account  expected  changes  in  the  exposure  after  the  reporting  date, 
including repayments of principal and interest, and undrawn commitments based on the 
Bank’s own experience. 

Loss  Given  Default  (LGD)  represents  the  extent  of  the  loss  that  the  Bank  expects  for 
exposures that are in default and is defined as the difference between the contractual cash 
flows and those that the Bank expects to collect, including collateral amounts. LGD, which 
is usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD, varies according to the category of the 
counterparty, the category and priority of the claim, the existence of collateral and other 
credit enhancements. 

The  Bank  assigns  credit  rating  to  each  loan  at  inception  based  on  the  internal  scorecard 
methodologies for Financial Institutions, Corporates or Project Finance and all loans are subject to 
annual credit review if rated to a category up to BB+, while all loans below that rating are subject 
to semi-annual credit review. The credit rating is primary input to the PD which is calculated based 
on statistical model and incorporates macroeconomic projections. 

The LGD estimates are according to values and determined estimates mainly by geography and 
by type of counterparty, with three main exposure classes: sovereign, public and private sectors. 
In case of sovereign default of member countries, the Bank believes that its payment would remain 
uninterrupted, benefitting from its preferred creditor status resulting in no credit risk of impairment 
loss from sovereign exposures or loans guaranteed by sovereign.  

The Bank calculates expected credit losses based on the weighted probability of three scenarios. 
More specifically the Bank uses a statistical model to produce forecasts of the possible evolution 
of macroeconomic variables (GDP and unemployment rate) that affect the level of expected credit 
losses of loans under a baseline and under alternative macroeconomic scenarios (adverse and 
favorable)  and  also  assigns  the  cumulative  probabilities  associated  with  these  scenarios.  The 
baseline scenario is the most likely scenario and is in line with the Bank's information for strategic 
planning and budgeting purposes.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

iii) 

Significant increase in credit risk 

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has 
increased significantly since initial recognition. When making the assessment, the Bank compares 
the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a 
default  occurring  on  the  financial  instrument  as  at  the  date  of  initial  recognition  and  considers 
reasonable  and  supportable  information,  that  is  available  without  undue  cost  or  effort,  that  is 
indicative of significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition. 

In  order  to  determine  whether  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  the  credit  risk  since 
origination,  and  hence  transition  to  Stage  2,  a  combination  of  quantitative  and  qualitative  risk 
metrics are used. All loans with at least a 3-notch downgrade in PD on the Bank’s internal ratings 
scale since origination, all loans for which the contractual payments are overdue by between 31 
and 90 days inclusive, as well as all loans placed on the ‘watch list’ are transitioned to Stage 2. 

For  financial  guarantee  contracts,  the  date  the  Bank  becomes  a  party  to  the  irrevocable 
commitment  is  considered  to  be  the  date  of  initial  recognition  for  the  purpose  of  assessing  the 
financial instrument for impairment. In assessing whether there has been a significant increase in 
credit risk since initial recognition of a financial guarantee contract, the Bank considers the risk that 
the specified debtor will default on the contract in line with the above determination for loans. 

Generally, there will be a significant increase in credit risk before a financial asset becomes credit-
impaired or an actual default occurs. The assessment of significant increase in credit risk is key in 
transferring  an  exposure  from  Stage  1  to  Stage  2  and  the  respective  change  in  the  ECL 
measurement from 12-month to lifetime ECL. 

iv) 

Credit-impaired 

A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the 
estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset 
is credit- impaired includes observable data about the following events: 
- 
- 
- 

Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower; 
A breach of contract, such as a default or past due event; 
The  lender(s)  of  the  borrower,  for  economic  or  contractual  reasons  relating  to  the 
borrower's  financial  difficulty,  having  granted  to  the  borrower  a  concession(s)  that  the 
lender(s) would not otherwise consider; 
It  is  becoming  probable  that  the  borrower  will  enter  bankruptcy  or  other  financial 
reorganization; 
The  disappearance  of  an  active  market  for  that  financial  asset  because  of  financial 
difficulties; or 
The purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred 
credit losses. 

- 

- 

- 

It may not be possible to identify a single discrete event – instead, the combined effect of several 
events may have caused financial assets to become credit-impaired. 

v) 

Definition of default 

The  definition  of  default  used  for  determining  the  risk  of  a  default  occurring  shall  be  applied 
consistently to all financial instruments unless information becomes available that demonstrates 
that another default definition is more appropriate for a particular financial instrument. The Bank's 
definition of default is based on the regulatory definition under Article 178 of the ‘Regulation (EU) 
No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union of 26 June 
2013 on prudential requirements for credit banks and investment firms and amending Regulation 
(EU)  648/2012’  (CRR).  A  default  is  considered  to  have  occurred  when  either  of  the  following 
conditions had taken place. 

22 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notes to the Financial Statements 

a. 

Qualitative 

Unlikeliness to Pay (UTP) criterion: the Bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay 
its credit obligations to the Bank without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realizing 
security. Below there are some elements that are taken as indications of unlikeliness to 
pay (in line with CRR (Article 178)). 

- 
- 

- 

- 

The Bank puts the credit obligation on non-accrued status. 
The  Bank  recognizes  a  specific  credit  adjustment  resulting  from  a  significant 
perceived  decline  in  credit  quality  subsequent  to  the  institution  taking  on  the 
exposure. 
The Bank has filed for the obligor's bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of an 
obligor's  credit  obligation  to  the  Bank,  the  parent  undertaking  or  any  of  its 
subsidiaries. 
The  obligor  has  sought  or  has  been  placed  in  bankruptcy  or  similar  protection 
where this would avoid or delay repayment of a credit obligation to the Bank, the 
parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries. 

b. 

Quantitative 

Past due criterion: the exposure is past due more than 90 days on any credit obligation to 
the Bank. 

Impairment losses for guarantees are recognized while a guarantee is in effect and the 
amounts  are  determined  based  on  the  level  of  utilization  of  the  guarantee.  The 
methodology is consistent to that of loan commitments, and such losses are included in 
‘Other liabilities’. 

Interest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount for financial assets in Stage 1 and 2. 
As the primary definition for credit-impaired financial assets moving to Stage 3, the Bank applies 
the  definition  of default,  and interest income is calculated on the  net carrying amount for these 
financial assets only. 

If the amount of impairment subsequently decreases due to an event occurring after a write-down, 
the release (i.e. reverse) of the impairment is credited to the provision for impairment asset losses. 
Unwinding of the discount is treated as income and remaining provision is then reassessed. 

3.6.2  Non-financial assets 

At each financial position date, the Bank reviews the carrying value of the non-financial assets and 
assesses whether there  is any indication of impairment. If such indications exist, an analysis is 
performed  to  assess  whether  the  book  value  of  the  specific  assets  can  be  recovered.  The 
recoverable amount is the higher amount between the fair value less costs of disposal and of 
the value in use (as calculated from the net cash flows). If the carrying value of an intangible asset 
exceeds its recoverable value, then an impairment loss is recorded in the income statement. 

3.6.3  Renegotiated financial assets 

When necessary, the Bank seeks to restructure a financial asset that may involve extending the 
payment arrangements and the agreement of new loan terms and conditions. These are generally 
renegotiated in response to an adverse change in the financial condition of the borrower. 

23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notes to the Financial Statements 

Modifications  occur  when  the  contractual  cash  flows  of  a  financial  asset  are  renegotiated  or 
otherwise  modified.  Some  modifications  result  in  derecognition  of  the  existing  asset  and 
recognition of a new asset with the difference recognized as a derecognition gain or loss, to the 
extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded, while other modifications do not 
result in derecognition. Modifications that result in derecognition are considered to be substantial 
modifications. A significant or substantial change is defined when the customer enters into a new 
loan contract (i.e. completely new product and new pricing) that has a different interest rate type, 
loan  amount,  term  period  (temporary  term  extension  is  excluded),  and/or  customer  (e.g.  from 
single customer to joint or change in one of the joint customer names). 

A distressed restructuring is an indication of unlikeliness to pay where this is likely to result in a 
diminished financial obligation caused by the material (change in the net present value of the asset 
by more than 10%) forgiveness, or postponement of either principal, interest or, where relevant 
fees. Distressed restructuring occurs when forbearance measures have been extended towards a 
debtor. Therefore, those forborne exposures where the forbearance measures are likely to result 
in a diminished financial obligation are classified as defaulted. 

Restructured operations will be considered cured and normalized after two successful repayments 
(average of 6 months per repayment) and could therefore be subject to a Stage movement. 

For loans that are modified the Bank recalculates the gross book value based on the revised cash 
flows  on  the  financial  asset  and  recognizes  the  profit  or  loss  from  the  modification  in  income 
statement. The new gross book value is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the 
original effective interest rate. 

3.6.4  Write-offs 

According to the IFRS 9 (B5.4.9), the gross carrying amount of a financial asset may be directly 
reduced when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the financial asset in its entirety or 
a portion of it. As such, the Bank may record a write-off of Stage 3 loans. The Bank may also, on 
an ad-hoc basis, examine the need for any further write-offs of Stage 2 loans if there is relevant 
evidence. 

3.6.5  Write-backs 

Recoveries  (write-backs)  of  an  asset,  or  part  thereof,  are  credited  to  the  income  statement  if 
previously written off. 

3.7 

Financial Liabilities 

The Bank recognizes a financial liability in its financial statements at the time of the arising from the item 
(that  is, the  day the transaction took place).  Financial liabilities primarily  include  (a) borrowings  and (b) 
other liabilities.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

3.7.1  Borrowings 

Borrowing  transactions  which  are  amounts  due  to  financial  institutions  and  debts  evidence  by 
certificates,  are  recognized  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  at  the  time  the  funds  are 
transferred to the Bank. They are measured initially at the fair value of the funds transferred, less 
any transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortized cost unless they qualify for 
hedge  accounting  in  which  case  the  amortized  cost  is  adjusted  for  the  fair  value  movements 
attributable to the to the risks being hedged. Interest expense is accrued in the income statement 
within “Interest expense” using the effective interest rate method. 

3.7.2  Other liabilities 

Other liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at FVTPL, are recorded at amortized cost. 
The amounts include accrued finance charges on borrowings and other accounts payable. 

3.8 

Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities 

Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities in the financial statements is permitted if, and only if, there is a 
currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a 
net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 

3.9 

Derivatives 

In the ordinary course of business, the Bank enters into various types of transactions that involve derivative 
financial instruments. A derivative financial instrument is a financial contract between two parties, where 
future payments are dependent upon movements in price in one or more underlying financial instruments, 
reference rates or indices. 

The Bank primarily makes use of derivatives for the below strategic purposes: 

- 

- 

- 

Many of the Bank’s issued securities, excluding commercial paper, are individually paired with a 
swap to convert the issuance proceeds into the currency and interest rate structure sought by the 
Bank. 
To manage the net interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks arising from all financial assets 
and liabilities. 
Through currency swaps, to manage funding requirements for the Bank’s loan portfolio. 

Derivatives  can  include  interest  rate  and  cross  currency  swaps,  forward  foreign  exchange  contracts, 
interest  rate  future  contracts,  and  options  on  interest  rates  and  foreign  currencies.  Such  financial 
instruments  are  initially  recognized  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  (SOFP)  at  fair  value  and  are 
subsequently measured at their fair value. They are carried in the SOFP as assets when their fair value is 
positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. 

Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are included in the income statement. Fair values 
are obtained from quoted market prices to the extent publicly available, discounted cash flows and options 
pricing models as appropriate. 

The Bank enters into  derivatives, to  protect the Bank from financial risks such as currency risk, market 
price risk and interest rate risk. Such hedges are entered into to lessen or eliminate economic exposure. 
The Bank’s policies on risk management are to not take significant interest rate or foreign exchange risks, 
and to aim where possible to match assets, liabilities and derivatives. 

The majority of the Bank’s lending activities is at floating rates linked to USD Libor or Euribor. When lending 
at a fixed rate the Bank will often use interest rate swaps to produce floating rate interest payments. 

The Bank’s borrowings, particularly bonds issuances, tend to be at a fixed rate and sometimes in currency 
denominations other than EUR or USD. The Bank in order mitigate the aforementioned underlying risks 
uses either interest rate or cross currency interest rate swaps to produce floating rate liabilities in USD or 
EUR. 

25 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notes to the Financial Statements 

All the Bank’s interest rate or cross currency swaps are explicitly tied to a balance sheet asset or liability. 
Typically, the fixed rate on the swap and the matching asset or liability have the same characteristics (term, 
payment dates etc.). 

Foreign  exchange  forwards  (paired  purchases  and  sales  of  currencies  on  different  dates)  of  maturities 
typically less than three months are not tied to specific assets or liabilities. These are undertaken to manage 
surpluses and shortfalls in EUR and USD and are not undertaken for speculative purposes. All derivatives 
are documented under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreement 
with Credit Swap Annexes (CSAs) and marked to market and cash collateralized daily. The Department of 
Treasury, under the guidance of ALCO and the supervision of the ALM unit, is responsible for the primary 
usage and managing interest rate and currency risks in the Bank’s statement of financial position. 

The notional amounts and fair values of the derivative instruments are disclosed in Note 14. The fair value 
hierarchy level of derivatives is disclosed in Note 5. 

3.9.1 Derivatives and hedge accounting  

The Bank designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency rate 
and interest rate risk in fair value or cash flow hedges. The bank does not apply fair value hedge 
accounting  of  portfolio  of  hedges  of  interest  rate  risk.  In  addition,  the  bank  does  not  use  the 
exception to continue using IAS 39 hedge accounting rules, that is the Bank applies IFRS 9 in full. 

In accordance with its wider risk management, as set out in Note 5, when a hedging relationship 
meets the specified hedge accounting criteria, it is the Bank’s strategy to apply either fair value or 
cash  flow  hedges  based  on  the  exposure  being  hedged.  Transactions  that  are  entered  into  in 
accordance  with  the  Bank’s  hedging  objectives,  but  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting,  are 
referred to in these financial statements as economic hedge relationships. 

At  the  inception  of  the  hedge  relationship,  the  Bank  formally  documents  how  the  hedging 
relationship meets the hedge accounting criteria, by recording the economic relationship between 
the hedged item and the hedging instrument, the nature of the risk, the risk management objective 
and  strategy  for  undertaking  the  hedge  as  well  as  the  method  that  will  be  used  to  assess  the 
effectiveness of the hedging relationship. Furthermore, both at the inception and on an ongoing 
basis (at least on each reporting date or upon significant change, whichever comes first), the Bank 
documents  whether  an  economic  relationship  exists  between  the  hedging  instrument  and  the 
hedged item. 

In order the Bank to apply hedge accounting, the following requirements must be met: 

- 

- 

- 

- 

There  must  be  an  expectation  that  the  fair  value  or  the  cash  flows  of  the  hedging 
instrument and the value or the cash flows of the hedged item, will “systematically” change 
in  response  to  movements  in  the  same  underlying(s)  that  are  economically  related, 
providing a degree of offset between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The 
assessment relates to expectations about hedge effectiveness and is only forward-looking. 

The  effect  of  credit  risk  should  not  dominate  the  value  changes  that  result  from  that 
economic relationship. 

The weightings of the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which define the hedge 
ratio of the hedging relationship, are the same as that resulting from the quantity of the 
hedged item that the Bank actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that 
the Bank actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item. 

If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to 
the hedge ratio but the risk management objective for that designated hedging relationship 
remains  the  same,  the  Bank  adjusts  the  hedge  ratio  of  the  hedging  relationship  by 
rebalancing the hedge, so that it meets the qualifying criteria again.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

For  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  requirements  and  when  measuring  the  hedge 
effectiveness / ineffectiveness, the Bank uses qualitative and supplementary quantitative analysis 
where  applicable.  Sources  of  hedge  ineffectiveness  between  the  hedged  items  and  hedging 
instruments, can arise from: 

- 
- 
- 
- 

Differences in timing of cash flows. 
Different applied discount interest rate curves. 
Non-nil fair value of derivatives at the designation date. 
The effect of changes in counterparties’ credit risk on the fair values. 

The Bank discontinues hedge accounting prospectively only when the hedging relationship (or a 
part thereof) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable) or the hedging 
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. 

The  notional  amounts  and  fair  values  of  the  derivative  instruments  designated  are  disclosed 
separately in Note 14. Hedge accounting disclosures are provided in Note 5. 

3.9.1.1 Fair value hedges 

Applying fair value hedge accounting enables the Bank to reduce fair value fluctuations of 
the recognized fixed rate financial liabilities as if they were floating rate instruments linked 
to  the  attributable  benchmark  rates,  thus  hedging  the  exposure  that  is  attributable  to 
interest rate risk/foreign currency risk and could affect reported earnings. 

The Bank only hedges changes due to interest rates, such as benchmark rates, which are 
typically  the  most  significant  component  of  the  overall  fair  value  change.  The  Bank 
assesses  hedge  effectiveness  by  comparing  fair  value  movements  of  the  hedging 
instruments and the hedged items attributable to changes in these benchmark rates. 

For  designated  and  qualifying  fair  value  hedges,  the  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the 
qualifying hedging instruments is recognized in profit or loss whereas the carrying value 
of a hedged item that is not already measured at fair value, is adjusted for the fair value 
change attributable to the hedged risk in the statement of financial position (“'Borrowings”'), 
with  a  corresponding  entry  in  profit  or  loss.  The  Bank  recognizes  the  hedging  gains  or 
losses from the hedging instrument in profit or loss, in the same line as the adjustment for 
the hedged item (“net  fair  value  gains (losses) on derivative instruments”). Accordingly, 
any ineffective part is recognized immediately in profit or loss. 

Upon  discontinuation  of  hedge  accounting,  the  fair  value  adjustment  to  the  carrying 
amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk, is amortized to profit or loss from 
that  date,  based  on  how  the  hedged  item  impacts  profit  or  loss.  If  the  hedged  item  is 
derecognized,  the  unamortized  fair  value  hedge  adjustment  included  in  the  carrying 
amount of the hedged item is recognized immediately in profit or loss. 

3.9.1.2 Cash flow hedges 

Applying cash flow hedge accounting, the Bank hedges the exposure to the variability in 
cash flows attributable to interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk associated with a 
recognized liability that could affect reported earnings. 

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI) and presented in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity 
(“Cash Flow Hedge Reserve”), whereas any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value 
of the derivative is recognized immediately in profit or loss (“Unrealized net fair value gains 
(losses) on derivative instruments”). 

27 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notes to the Financial Statements 

The amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is limited to the cumulative fair 
value hedge of the hedged item from the inception of the Hedge less any amounts recycled 
to profit or loss. 

For assessing the hedge effectiveness, the  hypothetical derivative approach is applied, 
which  involves  establishing  a  notional  derivative  that  would  be  the  ideal  hedging 
instrument for the hedged  exposure (i.e. swap with  a zero fair value at inception of the 
hedge relationship with the same critical terms as the hedged items) and then use as a 
proxy  for  measuring  hedge  effectiveness,  the  comparison  between  the  cumulative 
changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hypothetical  derivative  and  the  fair  value  of  the  actual 
hedging instrument. 

Provided  that  the  hedged  cash  flows  are  no  longer  expected  to  occur,  then  the  Bank 
immediately reclassifies the amount in the cash flow hedge reserve from OCI to profit or 
loss, however on hedge discontinuations, if the hedged cash flows are still  expected to 
occur, then the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is not reclassified until 
the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. 

3.10 

Financial Guarantees 

Issued financial guarantees are initially recognized at their fair value, being the premium (fee) received and 
subsequently measured at the higher of the unamortized balance of the related fees received and deferred, 
and the expenditure required to settle the commitment at the financial position date. The latter is recognized 
when it is both probable that the guarantee will require to be settled and that the settlement amount can 
be reliably estimated. Financial guarantees are recognized within other financial assets and other financial 
liabilities. 

3.11 

Property and Equipment 

Property  and  equipment  include  leasehold  improvements  and  transportation  and  other  equipment. 
Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost, which includes all costs that are required to bring an 
asset into operating condition. Subsequently to initial recognition, property and equipment are measured 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. 

Costs incurred subsequently to the acquisition of an asset, which is classified as property and equipment 
are capitalized, only when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Bank beyond 
those originally anticipated for the asset, otherwise they are expensed as incurred. 

At  each  reporting  date  the  Bank  assesses  whether  there  is  any  indication  that  an  item  of  property  and 
equipment may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Bank estimates the recoverable amount of 
the asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is 
written  down  immediately  to  its  recoverable  amount.  Gains  and  losses  on  disposal  of  property  and 
equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amount and are taken into account in determining 
net income or loss. 

Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of each asset to their residual values on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives. The annual depreciation rates applied were as follows: 

- 

- 
- 
- 
- 

Expenditure on leasehold buildings and improvements are 
depreciated over the remaining term of the lease 
Transportation vehicles 
Furniture and office accessories 
Personal computers 
Office and telecommunication equipment

3.12 

Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets comprise software expenditures and other intangible assets. These assets are amortized 
on a straight-line basis over the best estimate of their useful lives, which is software for desktops of three 
years and software for servers of five years. At each reporting date, management reviews intangible assets 
and  assesses  whether  there  is  any  indication  of  impairment.  If  such  indications  exist  an  analysis  is 
performed to assess whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is fully recoverable. A write-down is 
made if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. 

3.13  Right of Use Assets 

Right-of-use  assets  comprise  those  assets  that  the  Bank,  as  the  lessee,  has  control  of  the  underlying 
assets during the term of the lease. Control is considered to exist if the Bank has: 

- 

- 

The right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified 
asset; and 
The right to direct the use of that asset. 

The  Bank  provides  for  the  recognition  of  a  right-of-use  asset  and  a  lease  liability  upon  lease 
commencement in case that there is a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys to the Bank the right to 
use an asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration. More details are provided within the lease 
accounting policy Note 3.21. 

3.14 

Taxation 

In accordance with Article 52 of the Establishing Agreement, the Bank, its assets, property, income and its 
operations and transactions are exempt from all taxation and all customs duties in all Member Countries.  

The Bank is also exempt from any obligation for payment, withholding or collection of any tax or duty. Also, 
no tax shall be levied on salaries or emoluments paid by the Bank to employees. These tax exemptions 
are  also  included  and  elaborated  upon  in  Article  12  of  the  Headquarters  Agreement  with  the  Hellenic 
Government, ratified by Greek Law 2380/No.38/7.3.1996. 

3.15 

Provisions 

The Bank records provisions for present obligations and risks when the following circumstances exist (a) 
there is an existing legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events (b) for the obligation to be 
settled an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is present and (c) a reliable estimate of the 
amount of the obligation can be made. 

3.16 

Share Capital and Dividends 

In  accordance  with  Article  36  of  the  Establishing  Agreement,  the  Board  of  Governors  shall  determine 
annually what part of net income or surplus of the Bank from operations shall be allocated to reserves, 
provided that no part of the net income or surplus of the Bank shall be distributed to members by way of 
profit until the general reserves of the Bank shall have attained the level of 10% of the subscribed capital 
including all paid, unpaid but payable, and unpaid but callable share capital. 

3.17  Reserves and Retained Earnings 

In accordance with the Establishing Agreement of the Bank the general reserve is created from the profits 
of the Bank for meeting any unforeseeable risks or contingencies. The revaluation reserve represents the 
accumulated change in fair value of those financial assets that are measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income of the Bank. The retained earnings of the Bank is the accumulated undistributed 
and unallocated net income over the years.

3.18 

Income and Expense 

Interest income and expense are recognized in the income statement using the effective interest method. 
The  effective  interest  rate  (EIR)  is  the  rate  that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future  cash  payments  or 
receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument (or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to: 

- 
- 

The gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or 
The amortized cost of the financial liability. 

When  calculating  the  EIR  for  financial  instruments  other  than  purchased  or  originated  credit-impaired 
assets the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, 
but  not  the  ECL.  For  purchased  or  originated  credit-impaired  financial  assets,  a  credit-adjusted  EIR  is 
calculated using estimated future cash flows including the ECL. 

The calculation of the EIR includes transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an integral part of 
the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability. 

i) 

Amortized cost (AC) and gross carrying amount 

The AC of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial 
liability  is  measured  on  initial  recognition  minus  the  principal  repayments,  plus  or  minus  the 
cumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial 
amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any  ECL allowance. The 
gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the AC of a financial asset before adjusting for any 
ECL allowance. 

ii) 

Calculation of interest income and expense 

Interest  income  and  expense  are  recognized  in  the  income  statement  for  all  interest  bearing 
instruments using the effective interest rate method. Interest income includes interest on loans and 
advances  to  customers,  coupons  earned  on  fixed  income  investment  securities  and  accrued 
discount and premium on treasury bills and other instruments. 

Fees and direct costs relating to a loan origination or acquiring an investment security, financing 
or restructuring and to loan commitments are deferred and amortized to interest income over the 
life of the instrument using the effective interest rate method. 

Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of 
an impairment loss, interest income is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the 
future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. 

The EIR of a financial asset or financial  liability is calculated on  initial recognition of  a financial 
asset or a financial liability. In calculating interest income and expense, the EIR is applied to the 
gross  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  (when  the  asset  is  not  credit-impaired)  or  to  the  AC  of  the 
liability.  The  EIR  is  revised  as  a  result  of  periodic  re-estimation  of  cash  flows  of  floating  rate 
instruments to reflect movements in market rates of interest. 

However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the net balance of the financial 
asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to 
the gross basis. 

For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated 
by  applying  the  credit-adjusted  EIR  to  the  AC  of  the  financial  asset.  The  calculation  of  interest 
income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the financial asset improves. 

Other  interest  income/expense  includes  interest  on  derivatives  in  economic  hedge  using  the 
contractual interest rate.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

iii) 

Fees and commissions 

Fee  and  commission  income  and  expense  that  are  integral  to  the  EIR  on  a  financial  asset  or 
financial liability are included in the EIR. Other fee and commission income  – including account 
servicing fees, investment management fees, sales commission, placement fees and syndication 
fees – is recognized as the related services are performed. If a loan commitment is not expected 
to  result  in  the  draw-down  of  a  loan,  then  the  related  loan  commitment  fee  is  recognized  on  a 
straight-line basis over the commitment period. 

A contract with a customer that results in a recognized financial instrument in the Bank’s financial 
statements may be partially in the scope of IFRS 9 and partially in the scope of IFRS 15. If this is 
the case, then the Bank first applies IFRS 9 to separate and measure the part of the contract that 
is in the scope of IFRS 9 and then applies IFRS 15 to the residual. 

Fee  and  commission  income  from  contracts  with  customers  under  the  scope  of  IFRS  15  is 
measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Bank recognizes 
revenue when it transfers control over a service to a customer. The adoption of IFRS 15 had no 
impact  on  the  Bank’s  financial  statements  as  the  execution  and  completion  of  the  transaction 
requested by a customer is done at point in time, and this is consistent with the Bank’s existing 
accounting policy. 

Other  fee  and  commission  expenses  relate  mainly  to  transaction  and  service  fees,  which  are 
expensed as the services are received. 

iv) 

Interest rate benchmark reform 

At present the Bank is continuing the usage of Libor as the interest rate benchmark of which the 
Bank is exposed to, as there is uncertainty to the timing and precise form of the new benchmark 
that has yet to be finalized. The adoption will not have any material impact on the Bank’s financial 
statements. 

3.19 

Staff Retirement and Termination Benefits 

The Bank has established a pension plan, where the fund’s assets are held separately from the  Bank’s 
own assets, for all its eligible employees, consisting of three pillars: 

a. 

The first pillar is a defined post-employment benefit scheme financed entirely by the Bank. 
The scheme’s funding level and the Bank’s contributions are determined on the basis of 
actuarial valuations performed by qualified, independent actuaries on an annual basis at 
the end of each annual reporting period. The actuarial valuation uses the projected unit 
credit  method  and  a  number  of  financial  and  demographic  assumptions.  The  most 
significant assumptions include age, years of service  or compensation, life  expectancy, 
the discount rate, expected salary increases and pension rates. The actuarial liability is 
the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at the reporting date minus the fair 
value of the plan assets. The Bank is under the obligation to maintain the scheme fully 
funded, and to this effect, has always liquidated any past service deficit over the course of 
the year following the relevant actuarial valuation. 

Actuarial and asset gains or losses are recognized in ‘Other comprehensive income’, and 
net gains or losses are included in remeasurements where any change in the effect of the 
asset  ceiling,  excluding  those  amounts  that  have  been  already  included  in  personnel 
expenses, are also included. 

b. 

The  second  pillar  is  a  defined  post-employment  contribution  scheme  to  which  both  the 
employee and the Bank contribute equally at a rate of 0-12% of basic salary. The Bank 
has no obligation to pay further contribution if the employee discontinues their contribution.  
Each employee  determines his/her contribution rate  and the mode  of investment of the 
contributions. 

31 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Notes to the Financial Statements 

c. 

The third pillar is a defined contribution scheme funded entirely by each employee, up to 
40% of basic salary and is not recorded in the Bank’s financial statements. 

As  an  alternative,  staff  are  entitled  to  retirement  benefits  from  the  Greek  State  Social  Insurance  Fund 
(EFKA), which is a defined contribution scheme. 

Current  service  costs  in  respect  of  both  the  pension  plan  (a)  and  (b)  and  EFKA  are  recognized  as  an 
expense in the period which they relate and are included in ‘Personnel expenses’. 

The Bank may offer termination benefits to employees that are separated based on the Bank’s separation 
policy. These benefits, including indemnities and any related retirement benefits, are recognized in income 
as an expense in the same period they are incurred. 

3.20  Related Parties 

Related parties include entities, which the Bank has the ability to exercise significant influence in making 
financial and operational decisions. Related parities include key management personnel, and close family 
members of key management personnel. 

3.21 

Leases – the Bank as a Lessee 

On 1 January 2019 the Bank adopted IFRS 16, ‘Leases’.  This Standard has established the principles for 
the recognition, measurement and presentation of leases, and provides a single lessee accounting model 
that  is  required  at  the  commencement  date  of  the  lease.  The  objective  is  to  report  information  that  (a) 
faithfully represents lease transactions and (b) provides a basis for the amount, timing and uncertainty of 
cash  flows  arising  from  leases.  The  Bank  as  a  lessee  is  required  to  recognize  right-of-use  assets 
(representing the Bank’s right to use the underlying leased assets) and a lease liability (representing the 
Bank’s obligation to make lease payments), in the statement of financial position. 

The Bank applied the practical expedient in IFRS 16 to contracts that were identified as leases in order to 
determine  whether  an  arrangement  contains  a  lease,  on  transition  to  contracts  that  were  previously 
identified as leases under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. Consequently, the Bank’s leases are only for office space; 
and does not lease land, corporate vehicles, or technical or IT equipment, nor does  the Bank have any 
sale-and-leaseback transactions. The Bank elected to apply the modified retrospective transition approach, 
without restatement of comparative figures. Under this approach, the Bank was able to choose on a lease 
by lease basis to measure the right-of-use asset at the same amount as the lease liability. 

The Bank’s leases for right-of-use assets are initially recognized and measured at cost similarly to other 
non-financial  assets,  and  the  lease  liability  is  initially  recognized  and  measured  at  the  present  value  of 
future lease payments that are not paid at that date similarly to other financial liabilities. The lease payments 
can be discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if such is available, or alternatively the Bank’s 
incremental borrowing rate. The Bank will apply this measurement – except for those with lease term of 12 
months  or  less,  making  use  of  the  shot-term  leases  and  leases  of  low  value,  exemptions  under  this 
Standard. 

Regarding  subsequent  measurement,  the  Bank  acting  as  a  lessee,  has  applied  the  cost  model  for  the 
measurement  of  the  right-of-use  asset;  where  this  asset  is  measured  at  cost,  less  any  accumulated 
depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for the remeasurement of the lease 
liability. The lease liability is measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect any interest on it and 
that is separately recognized as an expense; the lease liability’s carrying amount is reduced to reflect the 
lease payments made. In case of any reassessments (e.g. a change in future lease payments resulting 
from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments) or lease modifications (e.g. a change 
in the lease term, lease conditions or any penalty) specified, the carrying amount of the lease liability will 
be remeasured to reflect revised lease payments.

UNCERTAINTY 

SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  JUDGEMENTS  AND  KEY  SOURCES  OF  ESTIMATION 

The preparation of the Bank’s financial statements requires Management to make judgements, estimates 
and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  income  and  expense  and 
accompanying notes. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that 
require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities affected in future periods. The 
Bank  believes  that  the  significant  judgments,  estimates  and  assumptions  used  in  the  preparation  of  its 
condensed interim financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances as of the date of 
preparation.  The  most  significant  areas,  for  which  critical  judgments,  estimates  and  assumptions  are 
required in applying the Bank’s accounting policies, are the following: 

a. 

b. 

Fair value estimates for financials instruments carried at fair value.  

The Bank’s method for determining the level of impairment of loan operations is described 
within  the  Accounting  and  further  explained  in  Note  5  Risk  Management  –  credit  risk 
section. In accordance with IFRS 9, ECL represents the average credit losses weighted 
by the probabilities of default (PD), whereby credit losses are defined as the present value 
of all cash shortfalls. The ECL is calculated for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 loans by applying 
the provision rate to the projected exposure at default (EAD), and discounting the resulting 
provision using the loan’s effective interest rate (EIR). The provision rate is generated by 
multiplying the PD rate and the loss given default (LGD) rate applicable to the loan. 

A  number  of  critical  accounting  estimates  are  therefore  made  in  the  calculation  of 
impairment of loan operations as follows: 

• 
• 

• 

Criteria used for staging assessment of loans and advances to customers. 
Assumptions  for  future  cashflows  of  individually  assessed  credit-impaired 
exposures. 
The  input  and  assumptions  used  to  estimate  the  impact  of  multiple  economic 
scenarios. 

For loans  that are individually assessed which have  a lifetime  ECL and that  are credit-
impaired  in  Stage  3,  the  impairment  allowance  results  from  the  impairment  test  that  is 
conducted on the basis of objective evidence obtained through a risk asset review process. 
An  impairment  test  includes  projected  cash  in-flows  and  out-flows,  available  for  debt 
service until maturity, which are discounted at the original effective interest rate (EIR) to 
reach a net present value for a particular operation, less any collateral that can be realized.

4.1 

Covid-19 

The continuation of the Covid-19 pandemic means that the Bank could face additional credit, market and 
operational  risks.  The  duration  of  the  pandemic  is  difficult  to  predict  at  this  time,  as  are  the  extent  and 
effectiveness of economic interventions by the governments and central banks in the region of the Bank’s 
operations. The Bank continues to monitor the developments and to manage the risks associated with the 
Bank’s various portfolios within existing financial policies and constraints. The two main areas that affect 
the Bank’s judgement and estimates are: 

1. 

2. 

The  Bank’s  equity  investments  which  will  likely  see  a  reduced  fair  value  due  to  the 
downward  pressure,  although  the  Bank  has  a  small  portfolio  such  investments,  and 
therefore the Bank’s profitability will not be materially impacted. 

The Bank’s loan portfolio due to business disruption that can occur in economic activity in 
the region will put pressure for borrowers, affecting those operating primarily in the service 
and consumer goods industries. This could likely force debt restructuring and an increase 
in defaults among less robust operations. The Bank’s profitability could be impacted by a 
severe increase in ECL on performing loans, driven by worsening of the macro-economic 
outlook scenarios. 

With regard of the Bank’s operational risk the information technology (IT) systems have proven they are 
stable, powerful and flexible, as the majority of the Bank’s staff were working successfully remotely. The 
Bank  is  also  investing  in  new  IT  infrastructure  to  expand  digital  and  cloud  transformation,  as  well  as 
strengthening the Bank’s cybersecurity and internal control systems.

RISK MANAGEMENT 

The  Bank’s  activities  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  risks,  some  of  which  are  not  within  the  Bank’s  control: 
including  risks  relating  to  changes  in  interest  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates,  declines  in  liquidity  and 
deterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolio. The Bank monitors and manages the maturities of its 
loans,  its  interest  rate  and  exchange  rate  exposure,  its  liquidity  position  and  the  credit  quality  of  each 
individual loan and equity investment in order to minimize the effects of changes in them relative to the 
Bank’s profitability and liquidity position. The BoD has approved risk management policies and guidelines 
that are delegated to the Management of the Bank for the identification and measurement of risk, as well 
as being subject to risk limits and controls. 

To manage risks the Bank has established an Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO), a Credit Committee 
(CC)  that  implement  the  Bank’s  credit  and  lending  policies,  the  Legal  Affairs  Department,  the  Risk 
Management  Department  and  the  Financial  Analysis  Department,  which  together  are  responsible  for 
devising, implementing and monitoring the Bank’s risk management policies, including financial, credit and 
market risks. 

The  ALCO  is  responsible  for  monitoring  and  managing  the  Bank’s  overall  asset  and  liability  position  in 
accordance  with  the  Bank’s  treasury  policies.  It  monitors  and  manages  the  Bank’s  liquidity  position, 
maturity gaps, interest income and expense and the condition of the international financial markets and is 
responsible for assigning market risk limits. The ALCO consists of members of the Bank’s Management 
and a member of the Treasury Department and has regular monthly meetings. 

The Credit Committee is responsible with respect to credit matters. Its key responsibilities include: approval 
of lending operations for submission to the BoD for final approval, establishing specific parameters (e.g. 
policies, limits, targets, guidelines) for operational decision-making, approval of changes to the manuals 
that prescribe how operations are to be analyzed, approved, administered and monitored and approval of 
any  amendments,  restructuring  and  other  operation-related  matters.  The  Credit  Committee  consists  of 
members of the Bank’s Management, and has regular meetings as required to monitor and manage overall 
risk concentration by reference to borrower and industry exposure and critically reviews each individual 
loan and equity investment proposal made by the lending business areas. A major function of the Credit 
Committee is to minimize the credit risk presented by each individual loan and equity investment proposal, 
and the overall portfolio risk of the Bank. 

Once  an  operation  is  approved  and  disbursed,  it  is  then  monitored  to  ensure  thorough  and  regular 
evaluations of its credit quality. Operations are monitored according to a schedule coordinated by the of 
Project  Implementation  and  Monitoring  Department,  with  inputs  from  the  originating  Operation  Teams 
regarding  the  availability  of  financial  data.  Monitoring  reports  are  completed  by  the  Bank’s  Project 
Implementation and Monitoring Department based on financial analysis prepared by the Financial Analysis 
Department. Risk asset reviews, based on the previously mentioned monitoring reports, are performed by 
the Risk Management Department, and may result  in a downgrade  or upgrade  of an operation’s status 
and, if a significant deterioration is noted, trigger an impairment test. 

Should  an  operation  display  signs  of  weakness  during  the  regular  monitoring  and/or  through  risk  asset 
reviews,  an  impairment  test  is  immediately  carried  out  by  the  Risk  Management  Department  and 
appropriate  remedial  actions  are  taken,  as  required.  These  measures  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  a 
detailed assessment of the financial and operational performance of the operation, additional due diligence, 
stopping disbursement of any undisbursed amounts, preparation of remedial strategies and carrying out 
further impairment tests. Besides, in addition to regular site visits carried out by the Operations Teams, 
such  a  visit  can  be  conducted  by  the  Project  Implementation  and  Monitoring  Department  and,  when 
appropriate, accompanied by the Financial Analysis Department.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

For the Bank a conservative approach to risk taking together with effective risk management, are critical 
to  the  Bank’s  continuing  operations.  The  application  of  sound  banking  principles  in  the  Bank’s  credit 
process seeks to ensure that the significant credit risks are properly identified and managed while other 
risks resulting from its activities are mitigated to the extent possible. 

Importantly,  the  Bank  is  recognized  as  an  international  financial  institution,  and  as  such  can  expect  to 
benefit  from  the  preferred  creditor  status  customarily  and  historically  afforded  to  such  institutions.  This 
preferred creditor status serves to provide an additional layer of comfort against the risks of non-payment 
on sovereign debt or by private sector borrowers as a result of local laws creating a delay or freeze on 
foreign-currency exchanges. The Bank is exposed to the following risks discussed below. 

Financial Risk 

The Bank’s exposure to financial risk is through its financial assets and financial liabilities including any 
receivables from these financial assets. The key aspects of the Bank’s financial risk are (i) credit risk (ii) 
liquidity risk and (iii) market risk. 

a) 

Credit risk 

The Bank is subject to credit risk, which is the risk that customers or counterparties will be unable to meet 
their obligations as they fall due. Credit risk arises principally from the Bank’s lending activities as well as 
other activities where the Bank is exposed to counterparty default risk. Regular reviews by the departments 
of Risk Management, Financial Analysis and Project Implementation and Monitoring are conducted of all 
exposures  within  the  lending  portfolios,  typically  on  a  semi-annual  basis,  though  exposures  that  are 
perceived to be more vulnerable to possible default are reviewed more frequently. 

At each review there is (i) an assessment of whether there has been any change in the risk profile of the 
exposure (ii) recommendations of actions to mitigate risk and (iii) reconfirming or adjusting the risk ratings, 
and for equity investments, reviewing of fair value. Where relevant, the level of the expected credit loss is 
evaluated and reconfirmed or adjusted. Responsibility for operations considered to be in jeopardy may be 
transferred from the original lending department to a corporate recovery team in order to most effectively 
manage the restructuring and recovery process. 

For  credit  risks  incurred  by  the  Bank’s  Treasury  in  its  investment  and  hedging  activities,  the  BoD  has 
approved policies and guidelines for the determination of counterparty and investment exposure limits in 
bonds,  that  includes  member  state  bonds,  and  euro  commercial  paper.  The  Bank’s  Risk  Management 
Department assigns and monitors these counterparty and issuer credit risk limits. Treasury credit risks are 
also reviewed on a regular basis by the Bank’s ALCO. 

The  table  below  summarizes  the  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  without  taking  into  consideration 
collateral, other credit enhancements or provisions of impairment.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

The  Bank  is  restricted  to  operating  in  its  11  Member  States  and  individual  country  limits  are  set  as  a 
maximum  at  30%  of  planned  commitments.  This  limit  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  BoD  approved 
operations,  minus  repayments  and  cancellations.  Individual  operations  are  further  constrained  by  the 
Single Obligor Limit and by monitoring of Sectoral Exposure. 

a6. 

Collateral and credit enhancements 

The Bank mitigates credit risk by holding collateral and other credit enhancements against exposure to 
customers and counterparties where it believes such security is necessary. The Bank defines security as 
mechanisms, procedures and assets negotiated in transactions that are meant to protect it against loss in 
case of non-performance.  Security  includes, but is not limited to, material assets,  financial instruments, 
guarantees, covenants and comfort letters. 

• 

• 

• 

Loans and advances. The BoD approved guidelines for taking security under lending operations, 
set the levels and types of collateral and other credit enhancements recommended for a given risk 
profile. 

The main types of collateral that may be obtained by the Bank are: mortgages on properties and 
equipment, pledges of equity shares and investment instruments, assignment of rights on certain 
contracts,  cash  or  blocked  deposits  and  other  third  party  guarantees.  If  necessary,  the  Bank 
reassesses  the  value  of  collateral  in  order  to  determine  if  additional  collateral  is  needed  to  be 
provided by the borrower. At 31 December 2021 the secured portfolio was 55.8% (2020: 53.9%) 
of the outstanding loans balance. 

Other financial instruments. Collateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and 
advances is determined by the nature of the instrument. Bonds and euro commercial paper held 
by  the  Bank  as  investment  securities  are  generally  unsecured.  The  Bank  may  hold  cash  or 
government securities as collateral against its derivative contract counterparties. At 31 December 
2021 the Bank had pledged as collateral for derivative transactions a net amount of EUR 14,150 
thousand (2020: EUR 3,320 thousand). 

For loans that are credit-impaired at the reporting date the Bank has collateral held as security, an 
amount of EUR 38,864 thousand to mitigate credit risk. The types of collateral with approximate 
values are real estate EUR 21,782 thousand, machinery and equipment EUR 6,175 thousand, and 
pledged shares EUR 10,907 thousand. 

b) 

 Liquidity risk 

Liquidity  risk  arises  in  the  general  funding  of  the  Bank’s  financing  and  investment  activities  and  in  the 
management of positions. It concerns the ability of the Bank to fulfill its financial obligations as they become 
due  and  is  a  measure  of  the  extent  to  which  the  Bank  may  require  funds  to  meet  those  obligations.  It 
involves both the risk of unexpected increases in the cost of funding the portfolio of assets at appropriate 
maturities and rates and the risk of being unable to liquidate a position in a timely manner on reasonable 
terms. 

The  Bank’s  liquidity  policy  aims  to  balance  the  term  and  currency  structure  of  the  Bank’s  assets  and 
liabilities. Liquidity management is concentrated on the timing of cash in-flows and out-flows, as well as 
the adequacy of available cash and liquid securities. The Bank maintains liquid assets at prudential levels 
to  ensure  that  cash  can  quickly  be  made  available  to  honor  all  its  obligations,  even  under  adverse 
conditions  and  that  the  Bank  has  access  to  the  funds  necessary  to  satisfy  customer  needs,  maturing 
liabilities and its own working capital requirements. For this, the Bank estimates all expected cash flows 
from assets and liabilities. 

The Bank takes into consideration, to the extent feasible, the guidance documents issued by the Basel 
Committee  on  Banking  Supervision.  The  Bank  sets  limits  to  control  its  liquidity  risk  exposure  and 
vulnerabilities and regularly reviews such limits. The limit framework includes also measures ensuring that 
in a period of market stress, available liquidity exceeds liquidity needs so that the Bank can continue to 
operate.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

The Bank’s commitment to maintaining a strong liquidity position is established in policies approved by the 
BoD.  The liquidity policy requires that the Bank maintain its liquidity position at a minimum of 50% of the 
following  12 months’  net  cash  requirement,  including  committed  undisbursed  project  and  trade  finance 
loans. 

The  Bank’s  liquidity  position  is  monitored  regularly,  and  the  ALCO  is  primarily  responsible  for  the 
management of liquidity risk and the liquidity profile of the Bank. The Bank’s liquid assets are maintained 
in short-term and negotiable securities that primarily are: (i) cash and bank balances (ii) short term deposits  
with investment grade rated counterparties (iii) Euro-denominated commercial paper issued by investment 
grade parties and (iv) investment grade bonds. 

The table below presents the maturity profile of the undiscounted cash flows for financial liabilities placed 
based on the remaining period from the financial position date to the contractual maturity date. It indicates 
the earliest maturity dates that the Bank’s counterparties have the ability to demand repayment. 

The figures represent undiscounted cash flows (except for  derivatives liabilities), and include estimated 
interest amounts, and therefore do not match to the statement of financial position. 

Contractual maturities for financial liabilities at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 were:

c) 

Market Risk 

Market risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates or market  prices of financial 
instruments may result in losses to the Bank. Market risk arises on such instruments that are valued at 
current market prices (mark to market basis) or those valued at cost plus any accrued interest (accruals 
basis). 

The Bank funds its operations by using the Bank’s own share capital and by borrowing on the international 
capital  markets.  The  Bank  aims  to  match,  wherever  possible,  the  currencies,  tenors  and  interest  rate 
characteristics  of  its  borrowings  with  those  of  its  lending  portfolios.  When  necessary,  the  Bank  uses 
derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to exchange rate and interest rate risks. 

The  Board  has  approved  risk  management  policies  and  limits  within  which  exposure  to  market  risk  is 
monitored, measured and controlled. The ALCO monitors and manages these risks while the asset and 
liability function within the Treasury  Department has primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with 
these policies and limits. 

c1. 

Foreign exchange risk 

The Bank’s risk management policies seek to minimize currency exposures or any unanticipated changes, 
favorable or unfavorable, in foreign exchange rates that could affect the income statement, by requiring 
net liabilities in any one currency to be matched closely with net assets in the same currency. The Bank 
will not take discretionary currency positions. This is achieved primarily by holding or lending the proceeds 
of the Bank’s borrowings in the currencies in which they were borrowed.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

The Bank regularly monitors its assets and liabilities in order to ensure the Bank takes no significant foreign 
exchange  risks  and,  after  swap  activities,  adjusts  the  net  asset  currency  composition  to  the  Bank’s 
functional currency to maintain a matched foreign exchange position. As a matter of policy, the Bank aims 
to keep foreign exchange exposure as close to zero as possible, with exceptions to this practice requiring 
approval from the ALCO. For local currency transactions the Bank matches the operation’s currency with 
borrowings  in  the  same  currency,  as  such  there  is  no  material  exposure.  The  tables  below  provide  a 
currency breakdown of the Bank’s assets and liabilities, showing that the effect of any currency fluctuations 
on the net exposure is minimal.

Interest rate risk 

Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate, favorably or unfavorably, 
due to changes in market interest rates. The length of time for which the rate of interest is determined on 
a financial instrument indicates to what extent it is exposed to that interest rate risk. 

The Bank’s interest rate risk management activities aim to enhance profitability, by limiting the effect on 
asset values of adverse interest rate movements  in  order to increase net  interest income  by managing 
interest rate exposure. The majority of the Bank’s loan portfolio is variable interest rate and the Bank has 
a policy aimed at minimizing interest rate mismatches between its assets and liabilities that seeks to ensure 
that the interest rate payment periods for its liabilities are matched as closely as possible to interest rate 
payment periods for the Bank’s assets. As a matter of policy, the Bank does not take discretionary interest 
rate positions. 

The  tables  below  provide  information  of  the  Bank’s  interest  rate  risk  exposure  on  non-trading  financial 
assets and liabilities. The  Bank’s assets and liabilities are included at carrying  amount and categorized 
either  on  the  contractual  maturity  date  of  the  financial  instruments  (including  derivative  financial 
instruments) or, in the case of instruments that re-price to a market rate of interest before maturity, the next 
re-pricing date as at the financial position date.

Sensitivity analysis 

Currency risk sensitivity 

The Bank is marginally sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations of the US dollar and the Euro. The 
Bank’s paid-in capital is held in Euro and the Bank’s loan portfolio is typically denominated as 60% 
Euro,  30%  US  dollar  and  10%  other  local  currencies.  In  addition,  the  Bank’s  administrative 
expenses are denominated in Euro, and the Bank’s income is typically denominated as 60% Euro, 
30% US dollar and 10% other local currency. The Bank has addressed this sensitivity to currency 
risk by increasing its percentage of loans denominated in Euro, and therefore increasing its Euro 
denominated income. 

Interest rate sensitivity 

The Bank’s interest rate sensitivity analysis comprises two elements. Firstly, there is the differential 
between the interest rate the Bank earns on  its assets and the cost of borrowing to fund these 
assets. For this element the Bank does, as closely as possible, match interest rate periods, thus 
minimizing or even eliminating sensitivity. Secondly, there is the absolute rate earned on assets 
that are funded by the Bank’s member’s equity resources. The majority of the Bank’s member’s 
equity  resources  are  currently  invested  in  the  Bank’s  loan  portfolio  at  floating  rates;  therefore, 
subjecting earnings on member’s equity resources to a minor degree of fluctuation. 

The table below details the re-pricing gap by currency. A parallel upward or downward shift in the EUR and 
USD curves of 50 basis points would have generated the maximum loss or gain respectively.

Hedges of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 

Fair value hedges 

The Bank uses pay floating/receive fixed interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps to 
hedge  the  interest  rate  and  foreign  currency  risks,  deriving  from  its  issuance  of  both  Euro  and 
denominated in foreign currencies debt (mainly USD, AUD and RON). The Bank hedges interest 
rate risk to the extent of the benchmark interest rate exposure of the floating leg (mainly Euribor, 
USD  Libor).  Provided  that  the  aforementioned  exposures  satisfy  the  hedge  accounting  criteria 
(please see Note 3.9.1), these are designated in fair value hedges. 

Upon designation,  the fair  value change  on  the qualifying  hedging  instruments  is recognized  in 
profit or loss. Also, the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is 
recognized in the same line item in profit or loss. If the carrying amount of the hedged item is not 
already measured at fair value (measured at cost or amortized cost), then it is adjusted accordingly, 
with a corresponding entry. The Bank recognizes any ineffective portion of the fair value hedge 
relationships  in  profit  and  loss  under  the  “Unrealized  net  fair  value  gains  (losses)  on  derivative 
instruments” line item. 

Upon  hedge  discontinuation,  any  hedging  adjustment  made  to  a  hedged  item  for  which  the 
effective interest method is used, is amortized to profit or loss, by adjusting the effective interest 
rate  from  the  date  on  which  amortization  begins.  If  the  hedged  item  is  derecognized,  then  the 
adjustment is recognized immediately in profit or loss. 

The Bank establishes a hedge ratio 1:1, by aligning the par amount of the fixed-rate liability and 
the  notional  amount  of  the  interest  rate  and  cross  currency  swap  designated  as  a  hedging 
instrument. Note 3.9.1 sets out more details on the accounting policy of the fair value hedges. 

At  31  December  2021,  the  Bank  held  the  following  interest  rate  and  cross  currency  swaps  as 
hedging instruments in fair value hedges of interest and foreign currency risk (2020: nil):

Cash flow hedges 

As  part  of  the  risk  management  strategy  objective,  the  Bank  also  uses  pay  fixed/receive  fixed 
cross-currency interest rate swaps, in order to hedge the exposure to the variability in cash flows 
attributable to interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk in respect to its issuance of fixed rate 
notes denominated in foreign currencies (e.g. CHF). When such hedging relationships meet the 
specified hedge accounting criteria, these are designated in cash flow hedges. 

Upon  designation,  the  effective  portion  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  derivatives  that  are 
designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) 
and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedge reserve, limited to the cumulative change 
in fair value of the hedged item from the inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of changes 
in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in profit and loss and is included in the 
“Unrealized net fair value gains (losses) on derivative instruments“ line item.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

The Bank establishes a hedge ratio 1:1, by aligning the par amount of the fixed-rate liability and 
the  notional  amount  of  the  interest  rate  and  cross  currency  swap  designated  as  a  hedging 
instrument. Note 3.9.1 sets out more details on the accounting policy of the cash flow hedges. 

At 31 December 2021, the Bank designated a pay fixed-receive fixed cross-currency interest rate 
swap (USD:CHF) in cash flow hedge relationship. The hedging instrument’s nominal amount was 
EUR 143,177 thousand, with the corresponding hedged item being Swiss franc notes issued, as 
included in the Bank’s statement of financial position (under “Borrowings” line item).  

For this outstanding hedged designation, the balance in the cash flow hedge reserve amounts to 
EUR 493 thousand loss (2020: nil) (see Note 24). 

During the year ended 31 December 2021, there were no amounts related to settled swaps.

Equity price risk 

The  Bank  has  a  small  equity  investments  portfolio  and  as  such  does  not  have  significant  market  risk 
exposure  concerning  foreign  exchange  or  equity  price  risk  on  this  portfolio.  At  31  December  2021  the 
Bank’s equity investments are classified at FVTOCI, except for one, and are primarily unlisted. 

The Bank takes a long-term approach of its equity investments and has no intention of exiting from any, 
therefore accepts the short-term volatilities in value from exchange rate and price risk. The Bank expects 
the effect on net income to be of little to no impact. 

Additional sensitivity information for the Bank’s  equity  investments has been  included under  ‘Fair value 
hierarchy’ later in this section and in the Note “Equity investments”. 

Operational Risk 

Like  all  financial  institutions,  the  Bank  is  exposed  to  operational  risks  arising  from  its  systems  and 
processes.  Operational  risks  include  the  risks  of  losses  resulting  from  inadequate  or  failed  internal 
processes,  people,  systems,  legal,  and  from  external  events  which  could  have  a  negative  financial  or 
adverse reputational impact. The Bank has a low tolerance for losses arising from the operational risks the 
Bank is exposed to. 

The Compliance and Operational Risk Management Department (DCR) has oversight on operational risk 
activities across the Bank. The Bank’s operational risk framework is a network of processes, procedures, 
reports and responsibilities that are used to identify, manage and monitor the operational risks of the Bank. 
These include committees, working groups, day-to-day practices such as the collection and analysis of key 
risks,  risk  of  loss  incidents  and  both  strategic  and  work  cultural  practices.  This  provides  a  structured 
approach  to  managing  operational  risk  and  seeks  to  apply  consistent  standards  and  techniques  for 
evaluating  risks  across  the  Bank.  The  Bank  has  a  comprehensive  set  of  policies  and  procedures  that 
indicate how operational risks should be managed throughout the Bank.  

The sources of operational risk emerge  in various ways, including business  interruptions,  inappropriate 
behavior of employees (including fraud), failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or failure of 
vendors  to  perform  in  accordance  with  their  contractual  arrangements.  These  events  could  result  in 
financial losses, as well as reputational damages to the Bank.  The Bank’s operational risk management 
focuses on proactive measures to mitigate the operational risk. 

Where any incident may occur the Bank systematically collects, analyses and reports data on that incident 
to ensure the Bank understands the reasons it occurred and how controls can be improved to reduce or 
better avoid the risk of any future incident.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

The  Bank’s  risk  and  control  assessments  of  the  key  operational  risks  in  each  business  area  are 
comprehensive and primarily bottom-up. They are based on  Bank-wide operational risk definitions, that 
classify risks under a standardize approach, cover the inherent risks of each business  area and control 
function,  provide  an  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  controls  in  place  to  mitigate  these  risks, 
determine the residual risk ratings and require a decision to either accept or remediate any remaining risk. 

Concerning cyber crime, which is risk of loss or damage to the Bank’s business areas and customers as a 
result  of actions committed or facilitated  through  the  use of networked information systems, the Bank’s 
Information Technologies Department (DIT), and information security policies and procedures ensure that 
all  servers  and  computers  have  up  to  date  antivirus  software.  Backups  are  made  regularly  and  regular 
access control checks, system penetration and vulnerability tests along with disaster recovery tests are 
performed. 

The Bank’s anti-cyber attack controls are checked and aligned with industry best practice by the DIT. 

The  Bank  regularly  produces  management  information  reports  covering  the  key  inputs  and  outputs  of 
operational risk. These reports are used to monitor outcomes against agreed targets and tolerance levels. 
The  Bank  utilizes  the  Bank’s  IT  systems  and  other  information  tools  to  ensure  operational  risks  are 
identified and managed properly. 

Overall,  the  Bank  is  committed  to  follow  the  best  practices  and  market  standards  in  the  area  of 
accountability, transparency and business ethics. Due diligence on customers and counterparties take into 
consideration  the  Anti-Fraud  Corruption  and  Monetary  Laundering  Policy  and  Know-Your  Customer 
Procedures. The Bank also has a contingency and business continuity plans, and a disaster recovery off-
site which aims to ensure the continuity of its operations and protect the interests of all the key stakeholders 
of the Bank, namely, the member countries, bondholders and other creditors as well as employees and 
their families, in the event of any disturbance in office locations. 

Fair Value Hierarchy 

For  the  above  financial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value,  the  Bank  uses  the  following  hierarchy  for 
determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: 

• 

• 

• 

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 

Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair 

 value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3: Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value 

 that are not based on observable market data. 

The tables below identify the Bank’s financial instruments measured at fair value.

There have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year. For Level 1 market prices are 
used whereas for Level 2 the valuation techniques used are broker quotes and observable market data. 
For Level 3 the valuation techniques used are the net asset value (NAV), and equity calculations based on 
EBITDA and market data.

discounts rates, average cost of capital, probability of default and loss given default.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

Equity investments comprises the Bank’s equity funds and equity participations. The main valuation models 
used to determine the fair value of these financial assets are NAV and EBITDA models. 

Although  the  Bank  believes  that  its  estimates  of  fair  value  are  appropriate,  the  use  of  different 
methodologies or assumptions could lead to different fair value results. 

Financial Instruments not Measured at Fair Value

Level 1 classifies financial instruments whose values are based on quoted prices for the same instrument 
in  active  markets.  Level  2  classifies  financial  instruments  that  can  trade  in  markets,  which  are  not 
considered  to  be  active,  but  are  valued  based  or  alternatively  supported  by  observable  inputs.  Level  3 
classifies financial instruments that have significant unobservable inputs, and as observable prices are not 
available the Bank will use valuation techniques to derive the fair value. 

Capital Management 

At the inception of the Bank, initial authorized share capital was SDR 1 billion, which was fully subscribed 
by the Member States. In December 2007 the BoG approved an increase of the Bank’s authorized share 
capital  to  SDR  3  billion  and  authorized  the  offering  of  SDR  1  billion  to  the  existing  Member  States  for 
subscription, with the objective of increasing subscribed capital to a total of SDR 2 billion. The increase 
allows the Bank to implement its operational strategy to a substantial degree. The Bank does not have any 
other classes of capital.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

In October 2008 the above new shares in the amount of SDR 1 billion that were offered for subscription to 
the  Bank’s  Member  States  were  fully  subscribed  and  allocated.  Accordingly,  the  Bank’s  paid-in  share 
capital was doubled from SDR 300 million to SDR 600 million. The remaining SDR 1 billion of authorized 
share capital has not yet been allocated. 

Pursuant to Resolution 131 of the BoG, that unanimously adopted the first amendment to the Establishing 
Agreement, which became effective on 21 June 2013. As of this effective date, and as per Resolution 131 
of the BoG, the unit of account of the Bank became the EUR and all of the Bank’s authorized share capital 
was redenominated from SDR to EUR. The conversion rate applied was SDR to EUR fixed at 1:1.15. 

The share capital usage of the Bank is guided by statutory and financial policy parameters. Article 15 of 
the  Establishing  Agreement  limits  the  total  amount  of  outstanding  loans,  equity  investments  and 
guarantees made for ordinary operations to 150% of the Bank’s unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves 
and surpluses, establishing a 1.5:1 institutional gearing ratio. Additionally, disbursed equity investments 
shall  not  at  any  time  exceed  an  amount  corresponding  to  the  Bank’s  total  unimpaired  paid-in  capital, 
surpluses and general reserve. 

The  Bank  determines  required  share  capital  as  the  potential  losses  the  Bank  may  incur  based  on 
probabilities consistent with the Bank’s credit rating. The main risk categories assessed under the share 
capital  adequacy  framework  are  credit  risk,  market  risk  and  operational  risk,  and  such  total  risks  are 
managed within the available share capital base that excludes callable share capital, while maintaining a 
prudent cushion. A main objective of this framework is to manage the Bank’s share capital by providing a 
consistent measurement of capital headroom over time. The Bank has no expectation for callable share 
capital to be called, and will prevent this need and use only available risk share capital as reserves, surplus 
and paid-in. 

At  the  36th  meeting  of  the  BoD  in  2008,  the  operational  gearing  ratio  was  set  at  100%  of  the  Bank’s 
unimpaired paid-up capital, reserves and surpluses, and the usable portion of the callable capital. This limit 
on the total amount of operations which includes all callable capital is approximately EUR 2.6 billion. 

Overall, the Bank preserves an actively managed capital stock to prudently cover risks in its activities. As 
a multilateral financial institution, the Bank is not subject to regulatory capital requirements. However, the 
Bank uses standards proposed by the Basel II Capital Accord as a benchmark for its risk management and 
capital framework. Pursuant to Article 5 of the Establishing Agreement, the BoG shall at intervals of not 
more than five years review the capital stock of the Bank. In substance, the primary objective of the Bank’s 
capital management is to ensure adequate share capital is available to support the Bank’s operations.

OPERATING SEGMENTS 

The  Bank  is  a  multilateral  financial  institution,  which  in  accordance  with  the  Establishing  Agreement,  is 
dedicated  to  accelerating  development  and  promoting  co-operation  among  the  Bank’s  shareholder 
countries. The Bank operates in a specific geographical area and the primary reporting format for business 
segments are the Lending and Treasury operations. Lending activities represent investments in projects 
such  as  loans,  equity  investments  and  guarantees.  Treasury  activities  include  raising  debt  finance, 
investing surplus liquidity, and managing the Bank’s foreign exchange, liquidity and interest rate risks. 

The Bank’s primary source of revenues is interest income from above mentioned activities. In addition, the 
Bank  also  derives  revenues  from  net  fees  and  commissions  and  other  income  that  comprise:  dividend 
income, net  gains from equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, net  gains from loans,  net 
gains from investment securities held at amortized cost and at fair value through profit or loss, and other 
income. 

Information  on  the  financial  performance  of  Lending  and  Treasury  activities  is  prepared  regularly  and 
provided to the President, the Bank’s chief operating decision-maker. As such, these activities have been 
identified  as  the  operating  segments  which  the  President  assesses  their  performance  in  a  manner 
associated with the financial statements and consistent with the prior year that is as follows:

At each reporting date, the Bank recognizes loss allowances based on either 12-month ECL or lifetime 
ECL, depending on the state of the loan. 

Total impairment losses on loans was EUR 44,223 thousand in 2021, a decrease of EUR 11,714 thousand 
compared to 2020. The decrease in Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is mainly attributed to the stabilization of 
the  Covid-19  pandemic,  driven  by  modest  improvements  of  macroeconomic  variables  used  for  some 
member countries as their economies bounced back from the Covid-19 pandemic. The increase amount 
in Stage 3 is due to the deterioration of a few loans reducing their carrying amount. 

In 2019 the Bank purchased a portion of a loan in deep discount an amount of EUR 8,278 thousand which 
paid EUR 2,097 thousand and credited an impairment loss of EUR 6,181 thousand recognized in stage 3 
rather than purchased credit impaired, as the loan agreement on the portion purchased specified that the 
contractual obligations would be identical as that of the Bank’s. 

Staging Criteria 12-month ECL (Stage 1) 

As  IFRS  9  does  not  distinguish  between  individually  significant  or  not  individually  significant  financial 
instruments, the Bank measures potential credit losses for all non-impaired operations (Stage 1 and Stage 
2)  on  an  individual  operation  basis.  Provisions  for  impairment  in  Stage  1  are  therefore  affected  by  the 
specifics of any particular  operation together with general market scenarios. They are  meant to  protect 
against  potential  risks  that  are  considered  present,  or  within  a  12-month  horizon,  and  derived  from 
potentially adverse developments in operating conditions beyond the control of individual borrowers. 

Staging Criteria Lifetime ECL (Stages 2 and 3) 

When an operation deteriorates substantially in credit quality, it enters Stage 2 and an expected credit loss 
calculation is performed on a Lifetime Expected Credit Loss (LECL) basis. Stage 2 operations are those 
that have experienced an overall credit quality downgrade but are still performing. They are not considered 
credit-impaired. 

Stage 3 operations have objective evidence of impairment that immediately impacts the ECL.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

Revolving Facilities and Undrawn Commitments 

Revolving credit facilities have no fixed term and they can be cancelled at the discretion of the Bank at any 
point in time. These facilities are subject to, at a minimum, an annual credit review. In this regard, the date 
of the latest credit review is considered the relevant date to assess if there is any increase in credit risk, as 
at that point in time. Following this, the Bank may amend the terms and conditions of the exposure. 

The  estimate  of  the  ECLs  on  irrevocable  loan  commitments  is  consistent  with  its  expectations  of 
drawdowns on that loan commitment.  Therefore, the Bank considered (i) the expected portion of the loan 
commitment that will be drawn down  within 12 months of the reporting date when estimating 12-month 
expected credit losses and (ii) the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over 
the expected life of the reporting date when estimating lifetime expected credit losses.  At 31 December 
2021 the amount of expected credit losses was EUR 193 thousand for loan commitments of EUR 208,203 
thousand (2020: EUR 983 thousand for loan commitments of EUR 245,143 thousand).

The  Bank  enters  into  derivatives  for  risk  management  purposes  and  contains  derivatives  which  are 
designated as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge relationships, more details of which are provided in 
Note 5. Derivatives which are not designated as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge relationships, are 
used to manage the Bank exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks. 

The  Bank’s  exposure  to  derivative  contracts  is  monitored  on  regular  basis  as  part  of  its  overall  risk 
management framework. For more information about how the Bank manages its market risks, see Note 5.  

The above derivative financial instrument contracts with financial counterparties have been documented 
under  International  Swaps  and  Derivative  Association  (ISDA)  Master  Agreements  with  Credit  Support 
Annexes (CSAs). Pursuant to such arrangements the Bank is eligible to offset assets and liabilities in the 
event of a counterparty default occurrence.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS 

A primary focus of the Bank is to facilitate access to funding for those small and medium-size enterprises 
with  the  potential  for  positive  economic  developmental  impact.  With  this  objective  in  mind,  the  Bank, 
together with a number of other institutions has invested in the entities as detailed below.

The  valuation  of  such  investments,  which  are  unlisted,  has  been  estimated  using  the  most  recent 
management accounts or the latest audited accounts as of 31 December 2021, as Management considers 
that  these  provide  the  best  available  estimate  of  the  investments’  fair  value.  The  techniques  applied  to 
perform these valuations include equity calculations based on EBITDA and market data. 

During the year the Bank had realized a net income of EUR 182 thousand from its investment in the Balkan 
Accession Fund. 

On disposal or exit of an equity investment for those at fair value through other comprehensive income, 
the cumulative gain or loss is realized with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized gain or loss that was 
recorded prior to the exit from that investment, and is not recycled to the income statement. 

As  of  31  December  2021  the  Bank  has  a  committed  amount  of  EUR  6,833  thousand  towards  further 
participation in the above entities.  Further analysis of the equity  investment portfolio is presented in the 
Note “Risk management”. 

As of 31 December 2021 the Bank has few equity investments where it holds slightly more than 20 per 
cent of the investee share capital, but does not exert significant influence, hence the investments are not 
accounted for as an investment in an associate under IAS 28.

The Bank has entered into a lease contract only for its Headquarters premises, which includes renewal 
options and periodic escalation clauses. There are no other commitments at end of year arising from non-
cancellable lease contract. On adoption of IFRS 16 the impact in the statement of financial position of the 
recognition of right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, together with the movement for the year, 
is analyzed as follows:

IFRS 16 indicates that at the commencement date, the lessee (the Bank) will discount the lease payment 
using (a) the interest rate implicit in the lease or (b) the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate if the interest 
rate implicit in the lease cannot be determined. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that 
a lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds to obtain (i) an asset of a similar value to the underlying 
asset (ii) over a similar term (iii) with similar security (iv) in a similar economic environment. As the Bank 
has only one lease arrangement that is nearing maturity, Management concluded that any adjustment or 
any subsequent interest does not have a material impact on the financial statements. 

The  Bank  presents  right-of-use  assets  separately  as  property  and  equipment,  and  the  lease  liability 
separately within payables and accrued interest, in the statement of financial position. Consequently, the 
Bank recognizes lease payments and interest, if any on the lease liability on a straight-line basis over the 
period of the lease term, similarly to any benefits received or that are receivable, in the income statement. 
When a lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payments required to be made to the 
lessor, by way of penalty, are recognized as an expense in the period the termination takes place.

SHARE CAPITAL 

From  the  Bank’s  inception,  and  in  accordance  with  Article  4  of  the  Establishing  Agreement,  the  Bank 
denominated its authorized share capital in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the International 
Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  Resolution  131  of  the  BoG  unanimously  adopted  the  requisite  amendments  to 
paragraph 1 of Article 4 and Articles 23 and 24 of the Establishing Agreement, to expressly include among 
the exclusive powers of the BoG the change of the unit of account of the Bank, and the redenomination of 
all capital stock of the Bank. These amendments to the Establishing Agreement became effective on 21 
June 2013 (the ‘Effective Date’). In accordance with such Resolution 131 of the BoG as of the Effective 
Date the unit of account of the Bank became the EUR and the authorized capital stock of the Bank was 
redenominated  into  three  billion  four  hundred  and  fifty  million  EUR  (3,450,000,000),  divided  into  three 
million  (3,000,000)  shares  having  a  par  value  of  one  thousand  and  one  hundred  and  fifty  EUR  (1,150) 
each,  inclusive  of  all  subscribed  and  unallocated  shares.  Accordingly,  as  of  the  Effective  Date,  all 
outstanding share capital commitments of participating members in respect of their subscribed shares were 
converted into EUR. 

The authorized capital stock of the Bank may be increased at such time and under such terms as may 
seem advisable. 

The Bank’s capital stock is divided into paid-in shares (fully paid and payable in installments) and callable 
shares. Payment for the paid-in shares subscribed to by members was made over a period of years in 
accordance with Article 6 of the Establishing Agreement for the initial capital raising purpose of the Bank, 
and as determined in advance by the Bank for capital increases (in the only capital increase of the Bank 
so far, the structure of payments specified was similar to the one in Article 6). The same Article states that 
payment of the amount subscribed to in respect of the callable shares is subject to call only as and when 
required by the Bank to meet its obligations. 

Under Article 37 of the Establishing Agreement any member may withdraw from the Bank by transmitting 
a notice in writing to the Bank at its Headquarters. Withdrawal by a member shall become effective and its 
membership shall cease on the date specified in its notice, but in no event less than six months after such 
notice is received by the Bank. However, at any time before the withdrawal becomes finally effective, the 
member may notify the Bank in writing of the cancellation of its notice of intention to withdraw. Under Article 
39 of the Establishing Agreement after the date on which a member ceases membership, it shall remain 
liable for its direct obligations to the Bank, and also remain responsible for its contingent liabilities to the 
Bank, incurred as of that date. No member has ever withdrawn its membership, nor has any ever indicated 
to  the  Bank  it  might  do  so.  Were  a  member  to  withdraw  from  the  Bank,  at  the  time  a  member  ceases 
membership, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of such a member’s shares by the Bank as part of 
the settlement of accounts with such a member, and be able to impose conditions and set dates pursuant 
to the same Article 39 of the Establishing Agreement. Any amount due to the member for its shares shall 
be  withheld  so  long  as  the  member,  including  its  central  bank  or  any  of  its  agencies,  has  outstanding 
obligations to the Bank, which may, at the option of the Bank, be applied to any such liability as it matures. 

If losses are sustained by the Bank on any guarantees or loans which were outstanding on the date when 
a  member  ceased  membership  and  the  amount  of  such  losses  exceeds  the  amount  of  the  reserves 
provided against losses on the date, the member concerned shall repay, upon demand, the amount by 
which the repurchase price of its shares would have been reduced if the losses had been taken into account 
when the repurchase price was determined. 

Under Article 42 of the Establishing Agreement in the event of termination of the operations of the Bank, 
the liability of members for the unpaid portion of the subscribed capital of the Bank shall continue until all 
claims of creditors, including all contingent claims, have been discharged. 

All  participating  members  had  fully  subscribed  to  the  initial  authorized  share  capital  in  accordance  with 
Article  5  of  the  Establishing  Agreement.  Subsequently,  at  the  Sixth  Annual  Meeting  of  the  Board  of 
Governors held on 6 June 2004 three Member States, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova requested a 50% 
reduction of their portion of subscribed capital, from 2% to 1% of the initial authorized capital and the BoG 
approved their request. On 5 October 2008 the new shares pursuant to the capital increase of the Bank 
were offered in the same structure as the initial authorized share capital, in the amount of EUR 1.15 billion, 
and were fully subscribed by the Member States.

Furthermore,  Azerbaijan  also  subscribed  to  the  3%  of  the  initial  authorized  share  capital  that  remained 
unallocated,  after  the  above  mentioned  participation  reduction,  while  Romania  subscribed  both  to  their 
allocation of new shares and to those that would have been allocated to Georgia had it chosen to participate 
in the capital increase. This subscription process followed a decision taken by the BoG in December 2007 
to triple the Bank’s authorized capital to EUR 3.45 billion and to double the subscribed capital to EUR 2.3 
billion, while leaving authorized capital of EUR 1.15 billion unallocated. On October 2011 the BoG approved 
the request from Moldova for a 50% reduction of its portion of subscribed capital, from 1% to 0.5%, and 
those shares were released to unallocated share capital. 

The above share capital is analyzed as follows:

In  accordance  with  paragraph  2  under  Article  5  of  the  Establishing  Agreement,  the  initially  authorized 
capital stock was subscribed by and issued to each Member as follows: 10% (EUR 115 million) fully paid 
and 20% (EUR 230 million) payable by promissory notes or other obligations which were not negotiable 
and non-interest bearing in eight equal successive annual installments in the years 1998 to 2005. 

Capital Increase 

The capital increase of EUR 1.15 billion is divided into EUR 345 million paid in capital and EUR 805 million 
callable capital. Pursuant to the Board of Governors decision in October 2008, the EUR 345 million paid in 
portion is divided into 10% (EUR 115 million) fully paid shares in 2010 and 20% (EUR 230 million) payable 
shares  by  promissory  notes  or  other  obligation  issued  by  members  in  eight  equal  successive  annual 
installments in the years 2011 to 2018. As of October 2011, the capital increase was reduced by EUR 11.5 
million  of  the  subscribed  share  capital,  due  to  an  approved  reduction  by  the  BoG  in  participation  by 
Moldova.

The Bank’s general reserve is maintained for meeting any unforeseeable risks or contingencies that do not 
qualify as provisions for impairment and is normally built-up from those released impairment charges during 
the year. 

The revaluation reserve contains fair value movements recognized on the Bank’s assets and liabilities that 
are recorded as other comprehensive income. 

The  other  reserves  contain  movements  to  the  remeasurements  of  the  Bank’s  defined  benefit  pension 
scheme, and a foreign exchange translation adjustment of EUR 3,587 thousand which has been crystalized 
from 2013 onward when the unit of account of the Bank became the EUR and all the Bank’s authorized 
share capital was redenominated from SDR to EUR (see section “Capital Management” of this report). 

The cash flow hedge reserve that is included in other reserves, amount of EUR 493 thousand loss for 2021 
(2020: nil) and comprises the effective portion of the cumulative amount of gains and losses on hedging 
instruments deemed effective in cash flow hedges.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 

Under the Defined Benefit Scheme 

If  separated  or  after  the  normal  retirement  age  (60  years  old),  a  staff  member  will  be  entitled  to  a  full 
immediate pension equal to 1% of his annual pensionable salary (i.e. average of the two best out of the 
last five years) multiplied by his/her years of service at the Bank. If separated at or after the early retirement 
age (55 years old), a staff member will be entitled to a reduced immediate pension, or deferred pension 
payable  from  any  month  until  the  staff  member’s  normal  retirement  age.  If  separated  before  the  early 
retirement age, a staff member will be entitled to a deferred pension payable from any month between the 
staff member’s early and normal retirement age. Upon separation at any age, a staff member will have a 
choice between the appropriate type of pension and a lump sum termination benefit. 

A qualified actuary performs an actuarial valuation of this scheme at each end of year using the projected 
unit method, which is rolled forward to the following year accounts. The most recent valuation date was 31 
December 2021. The present value of the defined benefit obligation and current service cost was calculated 
using the projected unit credit method.

The actual investment return on assets of the Fund for the year was  7.8%. The expected return on plan 
assets has been based on asset structure allowed by the Fund as well as the yield of high quality corporate 
bonds. The Bank estimate of contributions to be paid in 2022 will not materially differ from those paid in 
the current year.

EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD 

There  have  been  no  material  events  since  the  reporting  period  that  would  require  adjustment  to  these 
financial  statements.  Events  after  the  reporting  period  that  would  require  adjustment  to  these  financial 
statements are those that provide evidence of conditions that existed at 31 December 2021. 

Events  after  the  reporting  period,  that  are  indicative  of  conditions  that  arose  thereafter,  do  not  lead  to 
adjustment of the financial statements but are disclosed in the event that they are material. 

The  geopolitical  turmoil  that  begun  on  February  24,  and  the  consequences  thereof,  have  negatively 
impacted the economies of Ukraine, Russia and possibly affect further the economies of other neighboring 
countries. Those developments will negatively impact the quality of some of the Bank assets, and are likely 
to result in a sizeable increase in impairment losses. The losses associated with these developments will 
be recognized in the 2022 financial statements and because of the high uncertainty that exists as how the 
situation will develop it is not possible currently to reliably estimate those losses. 

At  31  December  2021  the  Bank  carried  on  its  statement  of  financial  position  the  following  loan  and 
investment securities: 

• 
• 

Ukraine: Loans of EUR 299 million and Debt investment securities of EUR 14 million. 
Russian Federation: Loans of EUR 485 million and Equities of EUR 1.3 million. 

 At 6 June 2022 there had been no other material events after the reporting period to disclose. 

On 6 June 2022 the Board of Directors reviewed the financial statements and authorized them for issue.  
These financial statements will be subsequently submitted for approval to the Board of Governors.
