0,Expected Credit Loss on Loans at amortized cost,
1,"Loans at amortized cost of the Bank amountedto EUR 2,329 million as at 31 December 2021(EUR 2,030 million as at 31 December 2020)and loss impairment to EUR 44 million (EUR 56million as at 31 December 2020) as presentedon the Statement of Financial Position.Τhe Bank measures Expected Credit Losses(ECL) for loans at amortized cost both on anindividual and a collective basis.The estimation of ECL on loans at amortizedcost is considered a key audit matter as it is acomplex calculation that involves the use of anumber of assumptions and parameters such asprobability of default (PD), Loss Given Default(LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) as well asassumptions around the inputs used andprobability weight of the multiple economicscenarios.Significant Management judgements alsorelates to the criteria used for the stagingassessment of loans at amortized cost.Management provided further information aboutprinciples and accounting policies fordetermining the allowance for impairment onloans at amortized cost and the management ofcredit risk in notes 3.6, 5, 12 and 15 to thefinancial statements.","Based on our risk assessment and following a riskbased approach, we have evaluated the impairmentmethodologies applied and assumptions made byManagement in relation to this key audit matter,which included, inter alia, the following auditprocedures:-we obtained an understanding of theprocedures and evaluated the design andimplementation of relevant internal controlswithin the business process.-we assessed the appropriateness of theBank’s IFRS 9 impairment methodologies.-with the support of our internal financial riskmodeling specialists we assessed thereasonableness of Management’sassumptions and input data used in themodel, including the analysis of theforecasted macroeconomic variables.  Wetested the mechanical elements of thecalculations such as the EAD, the PD andstage allocation and reperformed thecalculation of the ECL on a sample basis.-we tested the accuracy and completenessof critical data used in the ECL calculationby agreeing a sample of ECL calculationdata points to source systems ordocumentation.-on a sample basis we assessed thereasonableness of the estimated expectedcredit loss for the individually assessedcredit impaired exposures.We assessed the adequacy and completeness ofthe Bank’s disclosures in respect of credit risk,structure and quality of loan portfolio andimpairment allowance in accordance with IFRS 9."
