Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the \\n“Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements” section of our report.  We have been \\nindependent of the Bank during the whole period of our appointment in accordance with the International \\nEthics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) as \\nincorporated  into  Greek  legislation  and  the  ethical  requirements  in  Greece  relevant  to  the  audit  of  the \\nfinancial  statements  and  we  have  fulfilled  our  ethical  requirements  in  accordance  with  the  applicable \\nlegislation and the above mentioned Code of Ethics.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained \\nis sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. \\n\\nEmphasis of Matter \\n\\nWe draw your attention to note 28 of the financial statements where it is described the negative impact of \\nthe geopolitical turmoil in Ukraine and Russia, that begun in February 2022, on the quality of some of the \\nBank’s assets. \\n\\nOur report is not qualified in respect to this matter. \\n\\nKey Audit Matters \\n\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our \\naudit of the financial statements of the current year.  These matters  and the assessed risks of material \\nmisstatements were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in \\nforming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. \\n\\n2 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cKey audit matter \\nExpected Credit Loss on Loans at amortized cost \\nLoans at amortized cost of the Bank amounted \\nto EUR 2,329 million as at 31 December 2021 \\n(EUR 2,030 million as at 31 December 2020) \\nand loss impairment to EUR 44 million (EUR 56 \\nmillion as at 31 December 2020) as presented \\non the Statement of Financial Position. \\n\\nHow the matter was addressed in our audit \\n\\nBased on our risk assessment and following a risk \\nbased approach, we have evaluated the impairment \\nmethodologies applied and assumptions made by \\nManagement in relation to this key audit matter, \\nwhich included, inter alia, the following audit \\nprocedures: \\n\\nΤhe Bank measures Expected Credit Losses \\n(ECL) for loans at amortized cost both on an \\nindividual and a collective basis. \\n\\nThe estimation of ECL on loans at amortized \\ncost is considered a key audit matter as it is a \\ncomplex calculation that involves the use of a \\nnumber of assumptions and parameters such as \\nprobability of default (PD), Loss Given Default \\n(LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD) as well as \\nassumptions around the inputs used and \\nprobability weight of the multiple economic \\nscenarios.   \\n\\nSignificant Management judgements also \\nrelates to the criteria used for the staging \\nassessment of loans at amortized cost. \\n\\nManagement provided further information about \\nprinciples and accounting policies for \\ndetermining the allowance for impairment on \\nloans at amortized cost and the management of \\ncredit risk in notes 3.6, 5, 12 and 15 to the \\nfinancial statements. \\n\\n-  we obtained an understanding of the \\n\\nprocedures and evaluated the design and \\nimplementation of relevant internal controls \\nwithin the business process. \\n\\n-  we assessed the appropriateness of the \\n\\nBank’s IFRS 9 impairment methodologies. \\n\\n-  with the support of our internal financial risk \\nmodeling specialists we assessed the \\nreasonableness of Management’s \\nassumptions and input data used in the \\nmodel, including the analysis of the \\nforecasted macroeconomic variables.  We \\ntested the mechanical elements of the \\ncalculations such as the EAD, the PD and \\nstage allocation and reperformed the \\ncalculation of the ECL on a sample basis. \\n-  we tested the accuracy and completeness \\nof critical data used in the ECL calculation \\nby agreeing a sample of ECL calculation \\ndata points to source systems or \\ndocumentation. \\non a sample basis we assessed the \\nreasonableness of the estimated expected \\ncredit loss for the individually assessed \\ncredit impaired exposures. \\n\\n- \\n\\nWe assessed the adequacy and completeness of \\nthe Bank’s disclosures in respect of credit risk, \\nstructure and quality of loan portfolio and \\nimpairment allowance in accordance with IFRS 9. \\n\\nOther Information  \\n\\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  other  information.    The  other  information  comprises  the  information \\nincluded in the Annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.   \\n\\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any \\nform of assurance conclusion thereon. \\n\\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information \\nand,  in  doing  so,  consider  whether  the  other  information  is  materially  inconsistent  with  the  financial \\nstatements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, \\nbased on the work we  have performed,  we conclude  that there  is a material  misstatement  in this other \\ninformation, we are required to report that fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard. \\n\\n3 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements \\n\\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  in \\naccordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable \\nthe preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or \\nerror. \\n\\nIn  preparing  the  financial  statements,  Management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Bank’s  ability  to \\ncontinue  as  a  going  concern,  disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and  using  the \\ngoing concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease \\noperations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. \\n\\nThe Audit Committee of the Bank is responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process. \\n\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements  \\n\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are \\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes \\nour  opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit \\nconducted in accordance with ISAs, as these have been incorporated into Greek legislation, will always \\ndetect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists.    Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are \\nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the \\neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. \\n\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, as these have been incorporated into Greek legislation, we \\nexercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to \\nfraud or error, design and  perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence  that  is  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.    The  risk  of  not \\ndetecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, \\nas fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override \\nof internal control. \\n\\nObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the \\neffectiveness of the Bank's internal control. \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by Management. \\n\\nConclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting \\nand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events \\nor conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern.  \\nIf we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s \\nreport to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, \\nto modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date \\nof  our  auditor’s  report.    However,  future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Bank  to  cease  to \\ncontinue as a going concern. \\n\\nEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the \\ndisclosures,  and  whether  the  financial  statements  represent  the  underlying  transactions  and \\nevents in a manner that achieves fair presentation. \\n\\n4 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope \\nand timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control \\nthat we identify during our audit. \\n\\nWe  also  provide  those  charged  with  governance  with  a  statement  that  we  have  complied  with  relevant \\nethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other \\nmatters  that  may  reasonably  be  thought  to  bear  on  our  independence,  and  where  applicable,  related \\nsafeguards. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that \\nwere of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\nkey audit matters.  \\n\\nAthens, 6 June 2022 \\n\\nThe Certified Public Accountant \\n\\nAlexandra Kostara \\nReg.

Establishing the Bank \\n\\nBlack  Sea Trade and  Development  Bank (the “Bank”), whose headquarters are located at  1  Komninon \\nStreet, Thessaloniki, in the Hellenic Republic, was established as an international financial organization \\nunder the Agreement Establishing the Bank dated 30 June 1994 (‘Establishing Agreement’). In accordance \\nwith  Article  61  of  the  Establishing  Agreement,  following  the  establishment  of  the  Bank  the  Establishing \\nAgreement came into force on 24 January 1997. The Bank commenced operations on 1 June 1999. \\n\\nThe purpose of the Bank is to accelerate development and promote cooperation among its shareholder \\ncountries. As a regional development institution, the Bank is well placed to mobilize financial resources \\nand to improve access to financing for businesses in the whole region as well as for those active only in its \\nindividual Member Countries. The Bank offers project and trade financing facilities, equity participations \\nand guarantees. Bank financing of projects and programs is available directly or in cooperation with other \\nnational  and  international  development  institutions.  The  Bank  may  also,  where  appropriate,  provide \\ntechnical assistance to potential customers. \\n\\nAs  at  financial  position  date  the  Bank's  shareholders  comprised  of  the  following  11  countries:  Albania, \\nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Turkey and \\nUkraine. \\n\\n1.2 \\n\\nHeadquarters Agreement \\n\\nThe status, privileges and immunities of the Bank and persons connected therewith in the Hellenic Republic \\nare  defined  in  the  Headquarters  Agreement  between  the  Government  of  the  Hellenic  Republic  and  the \\nBank (‘Headquarters Agreement’) signed on 22 October 1998. \\n\\n1.3 \\n\\nGoverning Bodies \\n\\nEach of the Member States of the Bank is represented on the Board of Governors (BoG), with all powers \\nof the Bank vested in the BoG. With the exception of certain reserved powers, the BoG has delegated the \\nexercise of its powers to the Board of Directors (BoD), while retaining overall authority. \\n\\nBoG and BoD members can be changed at any time upon the discretion of the respective Member State. \\n\\n1.3.1  Board of Governors \\n\\nCountry \\nAlbania \\nArmenia \\nAzerbaijan \\nBulgaria \\nGeorgia \\nGreece \\nMoldova \\nRomania \\nRussia \\nTurkey \\nUkraine \\n\\nGovernor \\nMs. Adela Xhemali \\nMr. Arthur Javadyan \\nMr. Samir Sharifov \\nMs. Monica Dimitrova-Beecher \\nMr. Koba Gvenetadze \\nMr. Adonis-Spyridon Georgiadis \\nMr. Dumitru Budianschi \\nMr. Alin Chitu \\nMr. Timur Maksimov \\nMr. Murat Zaman \\nMr. Yuliia Svyrydenko \\n\\n11 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n1.3.2  Board of Directors \\n\\nCountry \\nAlbania \\nArmenia \\nAzerbaijan \\nBulgaria \\nGeorgia \\nGreece \\nMoldova \\nRomania \\nRussia \\nTurkey \\nUkraine \\n\\nDirector \\nMr. Arlind Gjokuta \\nMr. Andranik Grigoryan \\nMr. Famil Ismayilov \\nMs. Milena Boykova \\nMr. Ekaterine Guntsadze \\nMr. Ioannis Tsakiris \\nMs. Elena Matveeva \\nMs. Diana Blindu \\nMr. Dmitry Birichevskiy \\nDr. Serhat Koksal \\nMr. Taras Kachka \\n\\n2. \\n\\nBASIS OF PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\n\\n2.1 \\n\\nBasis of Preparation \\n\\nThe  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting \\nStandards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). \\n\\nThese financial statements for the year ended 2021 were submitted by the Management Committee to the \\nBoard of Directors (BoD) for approval on 6 June 2022 and were approved for issuance on that date. \\n\\nPursuant  to  Article  23  of  the  Establishing  Agreement,  these  financial  statements  shall  be  subject  to \\napproval by the Board of Governors (BoG) in their Annual Meeting to be held on 23 June 2022. \\n\\nBasis of measurement \\n\\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the below assets \\nand liabilities which have been measured at fair value: \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n\\nDebt investment securities at fair value through other comprehensive income; \\nLoans at fair value through profit or loss; \\nEquity investments at fair value through profit or loss; \\nEquity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income; \\nDerivative financial instruments; and \\nPlan assets. \\n\\nFunctional and presentation currency \\n\\nThe Bank’s functional currency is the Euro (EUR) as defined by the European Central Bank (ECB). \\nThe  Euro  is  most  representative  of  the  Bank’s  operations  and  environment  as  a  significant \\npercentage  of  the  Bank’s  lending  operations  are  in  Euro,  and  the  administrative  expenses  and \\ncapital  expenditures  are  primarily  denominated  and  settled  in  this  currency.  The  Bank’s \\npresentation  currency  is  the  EUR  and  values  are  rounded  to  the  nearest  thousand  unless \\notherwise stated. \\n\\nUse of Estimates and Judgments  \\n\\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make \\njudgments  and  use  of  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  application  of  the  accounting \\npolicies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and \\nliabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and \\nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those reported. Estimates and \\nunderlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized \\nprospectively. \\n\\n12 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nThe  areas  where  the  Bank  has  applied  judgement  and  used  estimates  and  assumptions  are: \\nestimation of expected credit losses of loans, fair valuation of financial instruments not quoted in \\nactive markets, including OTC derivatives and certain debt securities, impairment of investment \\nsecurities, estimation of retirement benefits obligation, and contingencies from litigation. \\n\\nThe areas involving a higher degree of judgment or areas where assumptions and estimates are \\nsignificant to the financial statements are disclosed in the Note 4. \\n\\n2.2 \\n\\nGoing Concern \\n\\nThe Bank’s Board of Governors considered the Bank’s ongoing financial sustainability when approving the \\nBank’s  “Long  Term  Strategic  Framework  (LTSF)  2021-2030”  in  June  2021,  which  reflects  the  Bank’s \\nprospects and the ways in which its shareholders would like it to evolve. \\n\\nFurther  and  in  support  of  the  new  LTSF,  the  Board  of  Governors  has  approved  an  increase  to  the \\nsubscribed capital of the Bank, to take place over the period 2023-2030. \\n\\nThe financial statements for 2021 have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Bank’s capital and \\nliquidity position were confirmed by the Board of Directors on 6 June 2022, the date on which the financial \\nstatements were approved. \\n\\nIn  the  context  of  formulation  and  approval  of  the  next  Medium-term  Strategy  and  Business  Plan  2023-\\n2026, the Board of Governors will provide in the second half of the year the necessary guidance and in this \\ncontext  will  recommend  adjustments  to  the  LTSF  2021-2030  to  the  extent  to  which  it  will  be  deemed \\nappropriate. \\n\\n13 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n3. \\n\\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\n\\nA summary of the Bank’s accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are \\npresented  in  this  section.  These  policies  are  the  same  as  those  applied  for  the  comparative  period \\npresented  taking  into  account  the  amendments  to  standards  which  were  issued  by  the  International \\nAccounting Standards Board (IASB), which are further analyzed below: \\n\\n3.1 \\n\\nAdoption of New and Amended Standards (IFRS) \\n\\nNew  standards  and  amendments  to  standards  which  were  issued  by  the  International  Accounting \\nStandards Board (IASB), applied on 1 January 2021: \\n\\n• \\n\\nIAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements \\n\\nIAS  1 sets  out the  overall  requirements for financial  statements,  including  how  they should  be \\nstructured, the  minimum  requirements  for  their content  and  overriding concepts such  as  going \\nconcern, the  accrual  basis  of  accounting  and  the current/non-current  distinction.  The standard \\nrequires a complete set of financial statements to comprise a statement of financial positio n, a \\nstatement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other comprehensive  income,  a statement of changes in  equity \\nand  a  statement  of  cash  flows.  Effective  1  January  2011,  earlier  application  is  permitted.  The \\namendments  are  effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  1  January  2023.  Earlier \\napplication is permitted. The adoption is not expected to have any material impact on the Bank’s \\nfinancial statements. \\n\\n• \\n\\nIAS 8: Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors \\n\\nIAS 8 is applied in selecting and applying accounting policies, accounting for changes in estimates \\nand  reflecting  corrections  of  prior  period  errors.  The  standard  requires  compliance  with  any \\nspecific IFRS applying to a transaction, event or condition, and provides guidance on developing \\naccounting  policies  for  other  items  that  result  in  relevant  and  reliable  information.  Changes  in \\naccounting policies and corrections of errors are generally retrospectively accounted for, whereas \\nchanges in accounting estimates are generally  accounted for on a prospective basis. Effective \\n1January 2011, earlier application is permitted. The amendments are effective for annual periods \\nbeginning  on  or  after  1  January  2023.  Earlier  application  is  permitted.  The  adoption  is  not \\nexpected to have any material impact on the Bank’s financial statements. \\n\\n• \\n\\nIAS 12: Income Taxes \\n\\nIAS 12 implements a so-called 'comprehensive balance sheet method' of accounting for income \\ntaxes which recognizes both the current tax consequences of transactions and  events and the \\nfuture tax consequences of the future recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of an entity's \\nassets  and  liabilities.  Differences  between  the  carrying  amount  and  tax  base  of  assets  and \\nliabilities, and carried forward tax losses and credits, are recognized, with limited exceptions, as \\ndeferred  tax  liabilities  or  deferred  tax  assets,  with  the  latter  also  being  subject  to  a  'probable \\nprofits'  test.  First  effective  as  Canadian  GAAP  under  Part  I  for  interim  and  annual  financial \\nstatements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after  1 January 2011. The amendments are \\neffective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. Earlier application is permitted. \\nThe amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. \\nEarly  adoption  is  permitted.  The  adoption  will  not  have  any  impact  on  the  Bank’s  financial \\nstatements. \\n\\n• \\n\\nIAS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment \\n\\nIAS  16  outlines  the  accounting  treatment  for  most  types  of  property,  plant  and  equipment. \\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  is  initially  measured  at  its  cost,  subsequently  measured  either \\nusing a cost or revaluation model, and depreciated so that its depreciable amount is allocated on \\na systematic basis over its useful life. \\n\\n14 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nEffective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after \\n1 January 2011, earlier application is permitted. The amendments are effective for annual periods \\nbeginning on or after 1 January 2022. Early application is permitted. The adoption is not expected \\nto have any material impact on the Bank’s financial statements. \\n\\n• \\n\\nIAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets \\n\\nIAS 37 outlines the accounting for provisions (liabilities of uncertain timing or amount), together \\nwith  contingent  assets  (possible  assets)  and  contingent  liabilities  (possible  obligations  and \\npresent  obligations  that  are  not  probable  or  not  reliably  measurable).  Effective  for  interim  and \\nannual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after  1 January 2011, earlier \\napplication is permitted. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after \\n1 January 2022. Early application is permitted. The adoption is not expected to have any material \\nimpact on the Bank’s financial statements. \\n\\n• \\n\\nIAS 41: Agriculture \\n\\nIAS 41 sets out the accounting for  agricultural activity  – the transformation of biological assets \\n(living plants and animals) into agricultural produce (harvested product of the entity's biological \\nassets). The standard generally requires biological assets to be measured at fair value less costs \\nto sell. Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on \\nor after 1 January 2011, earlier application is permitted. The amendments are effective for annual \\nperiods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Early application is permitted. The adoption will not \\nhave any impact on the Bank’s financial statements. \\n\\n• \\n\\nIFRS 1: First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards \\n\\nIFRS 1 sets out the procedures that an entity must follow when it adopts IFRS for the first time as \\nthe  basis  for  preparing  its  general  purpose  financial  statements.  The  IFRS  grants  limited \\nexemptions from the general requirement to comply with each IFRS effective at the end of its first \\nIFRS reporting period. Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years \\nbeginning  on  or  after  1  January  2011,  earlier  application  is  permitted.  The  amendments  are \\neffective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Early application is permitte d. \\nThe adoption will not have any impact on the Bank’s financial statements. \\n\\n• \\n\\nIFRS 3: Business Combinations \\n\\nIFRS 3 outlines the accounting when an acquirer obtains control of a business (e.g. an acquisition \\nor merger). Such business combinations are accounted for using the 'acquisition method', which \\ngenerally requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their fair values at \\nthe acquisition date. Effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years \\nbeginning  on  or  after  1  January  2011,  earlier  application  is  permitted.  The  amendments  are \\neffective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022. Early application is permitted if \\nan  entity  also  applies  all  other  updated  references  (published  together  with  the  updated \\nConceptual Framework) at the same time or earlier. The adoption is not expected to have any \\nmaterial impact on the Bank’s financial statements. \\n\\n• \\n\\nIFRS 17: Insurance Contracts \\n\\nIFRS 17 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure \\nof insurance contracts within the scope of the standard. The objective of IFRS 17 is to ensure that \\nan entity provides relevant information that faithfully represents those contracts. This information \\ngives a basis for users of financial statements to assess the effect that insurance contracts have \\non  the  entity's  financial  position,  financial  performance  and  cash  flows.  The  IASB  tentatively \\ndecided to defer the effective date of IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts to annual periods beginning \\non or after 1 January 2022 [The IASB has also published 'Extension of the Temporary Exemption \\nfrom Applying IFRS 9 (Amendments to IFRS 4)' to defer the fixed expiry date of the amendment \\nalso to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023]. The adoption is not expected to have \\nany material impact on the Bank’s financial statements. \\n\\n15 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n3.2 \\n\\nForeign Currencies Translation \\n\\nForeign currency transactions are initially recorded in EUR by applying to the foreign currency amount the \\nexchange rate between the EUR and the foreign currency at the rate prevailing at the date of transaction. \\n\\nWhen  preparing  the  financial  statements  exchange  gains  and  losses  arising  from  the  translation  of \\nmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at year end are recognized in the income \\nstatement. \\n\\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Euro at the exchange \\nrate at the reporting date. The foreign exchange gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between \\nthe amortized cost in Euro at the beginning of the year, adjusted for the effective interest, impairment and \\nprepayments during the year, and the amortized cost in the foreign currency translated at the exchange \\nrate at the end of the year. \\n\\nNon-monetary  items  that  are  measured  at  historical  cost  in  a  foreign  currency  are  translated  using  the \\nexchange  rate  at  the  date  of  the  transaction.  Foreign  currency  differences  are  generally  recognized  in \\nincome statement except for foreign exchange differences on non-monetary items which are at FVTOCI \\nas equity investments which are recognized in other comprehensive income. \\n\\nThe Bank uses the official exchange rates published for the EUR by the European Central Bank (ECB). \\nThe exchange rates used by the Bank at the financial position date were as follows. \\n\\n1 EUR \\n\\n= \\n= \\n= \\n= \\n= \\n= \\n= \\n\\nUnited States dollar \\nPound sterling \\nRussian ruble \\nAzerbaijan manat \\nGeorgian lari \\nArmenian dram \\nRomanian leu \\n\\n3.3 \\n\\nCash and Cash Equivalents \\n\\n31 December \\n2021 \\n1.13260 \\n0.84028 \\n85.30040 \\n1.92650 \\n3.50400 \\n542.61000 \\n4.94900 \\n\\n31 December \\n2020 \\n1.22710 \\n0.89903 \\n91.46710 \\n2.08900 \\n4.02330 \\n641.11000 \\n4.86830 \\n\\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  statement  of  cash  flows,  cash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  on  hand, \\nplacements with other financial institutions and debt securities with maturities of three months or less from \\nthe financial position date. These are highly liquid assets that are readily convertible to a known amount of \\ncash and are subject to insignificant risk of change in value due to the movements in market rates. \\n\\n3.4 \\n\\nRecognition and Initial Measurement, and Derecognition of Financial Instruments \\n\\nThe  Bank  recognizes  a  financial  asset  or  financial  liability  in  its  statement  of  financial  position  when  it \\nbecomes a party to the contractual rights or obligations. \\n\\n3.4.1  Date of recognition \\n\\nFinancial  assets  and  liabilities,  with  the  exception  of  loans  and  advances  to  customers  and \\nbalances due to customers, are initially recognized on the trade date, i.e., the date on  which the \\nBank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. This includes regular way \\ntrades, i.e., purchase or sale of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame \\ngenerally  established  by  regulation  or  convention  in  the  market  place.  Loans  and  advances  to \\ncustomers are recognized when funds are transferred to the customer’s account. \\n\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at \\nFair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its \\nacquisition  or  issue.  The  fair  value  of  a  financial  instrument  at  initial  recognition  is  generally  its \\ntransaction price. \\n\\n16 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n3.4.2  Date of derecognition \\n\\nThe Bank derecognizes a financial asset or a portion of a financial asset when (i) the contractual \\nrights to the cash flow from the financial asset expire, (ii) loses control of the contractual rights that \\ncomprise the financial asset or a portion of the financial asset or (i) the Bank retains the right to \\nreceive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed the obligation to pay it in full without material \\ndelay  to  a  third  party  under  a  ‘pass  through’  arrangement.  The  Bank  derecognizes  a  financial \\nliability  when  a  liability  is  extinguished,  that  is  when  the  obligation  specified  in  the  contract  is \\ndischarged, cancelled or expires. The evaluation of the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership \\nprecedes the evaluation of the transfer of control for derecognition transactions. \\n\\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or \\nthe  carrying  amount  allocated  to  the  portion  of  the  asset  derecognized)  and  the  sum  of  (i)  the \\nconsideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) \\nany cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in OCI is recognized in income statement. \\n\\nAny cumulative gain or loss recognized in OCI in respect of equity investment securities designated \\nas  at  Fair  Value  through  Other  Comprehensive  Income  (FVTOCI)  is  not  recognized  in  income \\nstatement on derecognition of such securities.  \\n\\n3.5 \\n\\nFinancial Assets \\n\\nThe  classification  of  financial  assets  defines  how  existing  information  is  reflected  in  the  financial \\nstatements.  In  particular,  the  valuation  method  and  the  impairment  calculation  are  defined  by  this \\nclassification, which are based on criteria established by the Bank.  \\n\\n3.5.1  Classification and subsequent measurement \\n\\nThe  Bank  classifies  a  financial  asset  in  its  financial  statements  in  one  of  the  below  three \\nmeasurement categories: \\n\\n1. \\n\\n2. \\n\\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost (AC): this category includes each asset or \\ngroup of assets for which the Bank's business model constitutes its holding for the purpose \\nof collecting contractual cash flows. Financial assets are classified at AC only if both of the \\nfollowing criteria are met: \\n- \\n\\nThe objective of the Bank’s business model is to hold financial assets in order to \\ncollect the contractual cash flows; and \\nThe contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash \\nflows  that  are  solely  payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  principal \\noutstanding: \\n\\n- \\n\\nThe Bank includes in this category financial assets which are non-derivative with fixed or \\ndeterminable  payments  and  with  fixed  maturities  meeting  the  above  criteria.  They  are \\ninitially recognized at fair value plus any transaction costs and including any premium or \\ndiscount that may  arise on the date of acquisition.  Third  party expenses, such as legal \\nfees, incurred in securing a loan are treated as part of the cost of the transaction. They are \\nsubsequently measured at AC using the effective interest method, less any allowance for \\nexpected credit losses. All such financial assets are recognized on settlement date. \\n\\nThese financial assets include cash and due from banks, loans and receivables accrued \\nthat meet the above criteria. \\n\\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), \\nwith  gains  or  losses  reclassified  on  profit  or  loss  on  derecognition.  The  Bank  classifies \\ndebt instruments (including euro commercial paper (ECP)) at FVTOCI when  both of the \\nfollowing conditions are met: \\n- \\n\\nThe instrument is held within a business model, the objective of which is achieved \\nby both collecting the contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and \\nThe contractual terms give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely \\npayments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding. \\n\\n- \\n\\n17 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nFVTOCI debt instruments are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses \\nthat arise from fluctuations in fair value recognized in OCI. Their fair value is determined \\nby  reference  to  quoted  market  bid  prices.  On  derecognition  cumulative  gain  or  loss \\npreviously  recognized  in  OCI  are  reclassified  from  OCI  to  income  statement.  Foreign \\nexchange gains or losses and interest income calculated using the effective interest rate \\nmethod are recognized in income statement. \\n\\nAll such financial assets are recognized on trade date. \\n\\nThe Expected Credit Losses (ECL) for debt instruments measured at FVOCI do not reduce \\nthe carrying amount of these financial assets in the statement of financial position, which \\nremains at fair value. Instead, an amount equal to the allowance that would arise if the \\nassets  were  measured  at  amortized  cost  is  recognized  in  OCI  as  an  accumulated \\nimpairment amount, with a corresponding charge to the profit or loss. The accumulated \\nloss recognized in OCI is recycled to the profit and loss upon derecognition of the assets. \\n\\n3. \\n\\nFinancial  assets  (equity  instruments)  measured  at  FVTOCI,  with  no  reclassification  of \\ngains or losses to profit or loss on derecognition. On initial recognition the Bank can make \\nthe irrevocable election, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, to designate investments \\nin  an  equity  instrument  which  are  not  held  for  trading  nor  contingent  consideration \\nrecognized by an acquirer  in a business combination, as a financial  asset measured at \\nFVTOCI.  Those  not  elected,  which  are  primarily  listed,  are  measured  at  Fair  Value \\nThrough Profit or Loss (FVTPL). Dividends received are recorded in the income statement. \\n\\nAfter initial recognition at cost, these financial assets are subsequently measured at fair \\nvalue with all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value (realized and unrealized), \\nincluding foreign exchange gains and losses, recognized in other comprehensive income, \\nand are not reclassified to income statement. For those financial instruments there is no \\nimpairment assessment. The fair value for those not purchased from an active market is \\ndetermined using accepted valuation techniques which use unobservable inputs. These \\nvaluation techniques used are net asset value, when this is deemed to approximate fair \\nvalue, and earnings-based valuations using comparable information and discounting cash \\nflows.  The  Bank’s  equity  investments  are  included  in  this  category.  All  such  financial \\nassets are recognized on settlement date. \\n\\n4. \\n\\nFinancial assets measured at FVTPL: this category includes financial assets that do not \\nmeet the criteria to be classified in any of the above categories as well as financial assets \\nthat the Bank holds for trading.  Their classification depends primarily on the following two \\nimportant factors (i) the Bank’s business model for these assets and (ii) the characteristics \\nof the contractual cash flows of the asset. \\n\\nThese financial assets are initially measured at their fair value and subsequently carried \\nat fair value on the statement of financial position with all changes in fair value gains and \\nlosses and foreign exchange gains and losses, recognized in the income statement in the \\nperiod in which they occur. Transaction costs on these financial assets are expensed in \\nthe  income  statement.  This  category  includes  derivative  financial  instruments,  equity \\nsecurities as well as any loans for which either of the criteria for recognition at AC is not \\nmet.  It can also  include a  debt instrument or  an equity instrument that  is not within the \\ncategory nor measured at FVTOCI. All such financial assets are recognized on trade date. \\n\\nIn  addition,  a  debt  instrument  that  could  meet  AC  criteria  can  be  designated  at  initial \\nrecognition as at FVTPL.  This classification option, which is irrevocable, is used when the \\ndesignation  eliminates  a  measurement  or  recognition  inconsistency,  referred  to  as  an \\n‘accounting mismatch’, which would arise from measuring  financial assets and liabilities \\non a different basis in relation to another financial asset or liability. \\n\\nAs at the reporting date the Bank has not designated, at initial recognition, any financial \\nasset as at FVTPL. \\n\\n18 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n3.5.2  Measurement \\n\\nThe Bank measures financial assets at fair value on initial recognition, as detailed above. In the \\nevent the Bank considers that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price, \\nthat difference is recognized as a gain or loss on initial recognition but only if the fair value is based \\non a requested active market price for identical assets or is based on a valuation technique using \\ndata solely from identified markets. In all other cases, the difference between the transaction price \\nand  the  fair  value  is  deferred  and  is  only  recognized  in  the  income  statement  when  the  inputs \\nbecome observable, or when the instrument is derecognized. \\n\\nFinancial assets that are subsequently measured at either AC or debt instruments at FVTOCI, are \\nsubject to provisions for impairment. \\n\\nBased on the Bank's credit policy, the Bank does not originate credit-impaired financial assets, nor \\ndoes the Bank purchase credit-impaired assets, exception being those loans would be acquired at \\na deep discount. \\n\\nFinancial  assets  are  not  reclassified  subsequent  to  their  initial  recognition,  except  in  the  period \\nafter the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets. \\n\\n3.5.3  Business model assessment \\n\\nThe factor of the business model refers, amongst others, to the manner in which the Bank manages \\nits financial assets by classifying them in portfolios that are part of its business model. The adopted \\nbusiness  model  determines  the  source  of  revenue,  as  it  arises  from  individual  portfolios  either \\nthrough  the  collection  of  contractual  cash  flows  or  from  the  sale  of  financial  assets  or  the \\ncombination of the above. \\n\\nThe  assessment  of  the  business  model  reflects  the  Bank's  strategy  under  normal  business \\nconditions.  The  assessment  is  not  affected  by  actions  required  in  ‘emergency  situations’  (e.g.: \\nliquidity needs, non-inherent capital requirements for credit risk, etc.). Also, Management decisions \\ntaken to comply with new regulatory guidelines are not included in the assessment. \\n\\nIn general, the Bank has included the majority of its loan portfolios in the hold-to-collect business \\nmodel. The assessment of a business model is made within the definition of operational objectives \\nas defined by the Bank's Management, as well as in the operational management of its assets. \\nThe assessment is effected at portfolio level rather than at individual asset levels. \\n\\nThe Business Model applied to loan portfolio, treasury portfolio and equity investment portfolio is \\nreassessed  at  each  reporting  period.  The  reassessment  of  the  Business  Model  has  been \\nestablished in order to determine if evidence initially used has changed. The assessment process \\napplied by the Bank through its business model, based on strategic objectives, classifies its assets \\nin the following three categories in accordance with IFRS 9: \\n\\ni) \\n\\nHold to collect \\n\\nEach asset or group of assets for which the Bank's business model recommends that it be held for \\nthe purpose of collecting contractual cash flows is classified as ‘Hold to collect’. \\n\\nii) \\n\\nHold to collect and sell \\n\\nEach asset or group of assets for which the Bank's business model recommends that it be held for \\nthe purpose of collecting contractual cash flows and selling them when the strategic planning of \\ntheir acquisition has been achieved is classified as ‘Hold to collect and sell’. \\n\\niii) \\n\\nTrading portfolio \\n\\nThe financial assets held for trading are classified as ‘Trading portfolio’. The Bank had no financial \\nassets in trading portfolio. \\n\\n19 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n3.5.4  Loans \\n\\nLoans  originated  by  the  Bank,  is  where  money  is  provided  directly  to  the  borrower.  Loans  are \\ninitially  recorded  at  fair  value,  which  is  usually  the  net  amount  disbursed  at  inception  including \\ndirectly  attributable  origination  costs  and  certain  types  of  fees  or  commission  (e.g.  syndication \\ncommission,  front-end,  commitment  fees  and  handling  charges)  that  are  regarded  as  an \\nadjustment to the effective interest rate of the loan, and are subsequently measured at amortized \\ncost using the effective interest rate method. \\n\\nThe Bank classifies in  loan category bonds which are purchased with a view of a development \\nimpact and such purchases are performed based on the Bank’s loan financing criteria and follow \\nthe thorough appraisal and approval process of the Bank. Such bonds at 31 December 2021 were \\na  gross  amount  of  EUR  294,330  thousand  (2020:  EUR  267,588  thousand).  Management  has \\nconcluded that presentation within loans present fairly the Bank’s financial position. \\n\\nLoans that are designated as at FVTPL are recognized at a value arrived at by using a combination \\nof discounted cash flow models. These models incorporate market data pertaining to interest rates, \\na borrower’s credit rating, and underlying assets. Where unobservable inputs have been used, a \\nsensitivity  analysis  has  been  included  under  ‘fair  value  hierarchy’  described  within  the  ‘Risk \\nManagement’ section of this report. \\n\\n3.6 \\n\\nImpairment \\n\\n3.6.1  Financial assets \\n\\nThe Bank records an allowance for expected credit loss for all loans and loans receivables, and \\nother  debt  instruments  held  at  amortized  cost,  together  with  off  balance  sheet  items  (loan \\ncommitments  and  financial  guarantee  contracts).  In  this  section,  all  referred  to  as  ‘financial \\ninstruments’. Equity instruments are not subject to impairment under IFRS 9. \\n\\ni) \\n\\nCalculation of expected credit loss \\n\\nECLs are a probability-weighted average estimate of credit losses that reflects the time value of \\nmoney. Upon initial recognition of the financial instruments in scope of the impairment policy, the \\nBank  records  a  loss  allowance  equal  to  12-month  ECL,  being  the  ECL  that  result  from  default \\nevents  that  are  possible  within  the  next  twelve  months.  Subsequently,  for  those  financial \\ninstruments  that  have  experienced  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  (SICR)  since  initial \\nrecognition, a loss allowance equal to lifetime ECL is recognized, arising from default events that \\nare possible over the expected life of the instrument. The expected credit losses are weighted on \\nthe basis of three macroeconomic scenarios (adverse, basic and favorable). \\n\\nFor the purposes of calculating expected credit losses, the financial instruments are classified in \\nthree stages as follows:  \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nStage 1: Stage 1 includes performing exposures that do not have significant increase in \\ncredit risk since initial recognition. Stage 1 also includes exposures for which credit risk \\nhas been  improved  and the exposure has  been reclassified from  Stages  2 or  3. In this \\nstage expected credit losses are recognized based on the probability of default within the \\nnext 12 months. \\n\\nStage 2: Stage  2 includes  performing  exposures for which there  has been  a significant \\nincrease in credit risk since initial recognition. Stage 2 also includes exposures for which \\nthe credit risk has improved, and the exposure has been reclassified from stage 3. In this \\nstage, lifetime expected credit losses are recognized. \\n\\nStage 3: Stage 3 includes non-performing / credit-impaired exposures. In this stage lifetime \\nexpected credit losses are recognized. \\n\\n20 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nThe Bank calculates impairment losses on a portfolio basis, except for financial assets that are \\ncredit-impaired in which case they are calculated on an individual basis. The Bank applies three \\nmain components to measure expected credit losses which are a LGD, PD and EAD, and assigns \\ngeneral market scenarios for potential credit risk deterioration. There can be transfers of exposures \\nfrom  one  stage  to  another,  depending  on  whether  there  is  a  change  in  the  credit  risk  of  that \\nexposure. Probability of default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. \\n\\nThe Bank uses information obtained from the Global Emerging Markets (GEMs) database in order \\nto assign LGD to its loan asset classes. GEMs is an International Financial Institution (IFI) wide \\ninitiative  designed to pool  default and recovery rates  experienced  by IFIs  in  emerging markets. \\nTreasury asset classes derive their PDs from the assigning rating agency. LGD is an estimate of \\nthe loss arising on default. The Bank uses information obtained from the GEMs database to assign \\nLGDs to its lending asset classes, and treasury asset classes derive their LGDs from the assigning \\nrating agency. \\n\\nii) \\n\\nBasic parameters used for the calculation of expected credit loss  \\n\\nThe calculation of expected credit losses is based on the following parameters:  \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nProbability of Default (PD) represents the probability that a debtor will default on his debt \\nobligations either over the next twelve months or over the remaining maturity of his debt. \\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, the Bank uses non-discriminatory point-in-time PDs that adjust \\nto macroeconomic assumptions using the Expected Credit Loss. \\n\\nExposure at Default (EAD) is defined as the estimate of the exposure at a future default \\ndate,  taking  into  account  expected  changes  in  the  exposure  after  the  reporting  date, \\nincluding repayments of principal and interest, and undrawn commitments based on the \\nBank’s own experience. \\n\\nLoss  Given  Default  (LGD)  represents  the  extent  of  the  loss  that  the  Bank  expects  for \\nexposures that are in default and is defined as the difference between the contractual cash \\nflows and those that the Bank expects to collect, including collateral amounts. LGD, which \\nis usually expressed as a percentage of the EAD, varies according to the category of the \\ncounterparty, the category and priority of the claim, the existence of collateral and other \\ncredit enhancements. \\n\\nThe  Bank  assigns  credit  rating  to  each  loan  at  inception  based  on  the  internal  scorecard \\nmethodologies for Financial Institutions, Corporates or Project Finance and all loans are subject to \\nannual credit review if rated to a category up to BB+, while all loans below that rating are subject \\nto semi-annual credit review. The credit rating is primary input to the PD which is calculated based \\non statistical model and incorporates macroeconomic projections. \\n\\nThe LGD estimates are according to values and determined estimates mainly by geography and \\nby type of counterparty, with three main exposure classes: sovereign, public and private sectors. \\nIn case of sovereign default of member countries, the Bank believes that its payment would remain \\nuninterrupted, benefitting from its preferred creditor status resulting in no credit risk of impairment \\nloss from sovereign exposures or loans guaranteed by sovereign.  \\n\\nThe Bank calculates expected credit losses based on the weighted probability of three scenarios. \\nMore specifically the Bank uses a statistical model to produce forecasts of the possible evolution \\nof macroeconomic variables (GDP and unemployment rate) that affect the level of expected credit \\nlosses of loans under a baseline and under alternative macroeconomic scenarios (adverse and \\nfavorable)  and  also  assigns  the  cumulative  probabilities  associated  with  these  scenarios.  The \\nbaseline scenario is the most likely scenario and is in line with the Bank's information for strategic \\nplanning and budgeting purposes. \\n\\n21 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\niii) \\n\\nSignificant increase in credit risk \\n\\nAt each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether the credit risk on a financial instrument has \\nincreased significantly since initial recognition. When making the assessment, the Bank compares \\nthe risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument as at the reporting date with the risk of a \\ndefault  occurring  on  the  financial  instrument  as  at  the  date  of  initial  recognition  and  considers \\nreasonable  and  supportable  information,  that  is  available  without  undue  cost  or  effort,  that  is \\nindicative of significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition. \\n\\nIn  order  to  determine  whether  there  has  been  a  significant  increase  in  the  credit  risk  since \\norigination,  and  hence  transition  to  Stage  2,  a  combination  of  quantitative  and  qualitative  risk \\nmetrics are used. All loans with at least a 3-notch downgrade in PD on the Bank’s internal ratings \\nscale since origination, all loans for which the contractual payments are overdue by between 31 \\nand 90 days inclusive, as well as all loans placed on the ‘watch list’ are transitioned to Stage 2. \\n\\nFor  financial  guarantee  contracts,  the  date  the  Bank  becomes  a  party  to  the  irrevocable \\ncommitment  is  considered  to  be  the  date  of  initial  recognition  for  the  purpose  of  assessing  the \\nfinancial instrument for impairment. In assessing whether there has been a significant increase in \\ncredit risk since initial recognition of a financial guarantee contract, the Bank considers the risk that \\nthe specified debtor will default on the contract in line with the above determination for loans. \\n\\nGenerally, there will be a significant increase in credit risk before a financial asset becomes credit-\\nimpaired or an actual default occurs. The assessment of significant increase in credit risk is key in \\ntransferring  an  exposure  from  Stage  1  to  Stage  2  and  the  respective  change  in  the  ECL \\nmeasurement from 12-month to lifetime ECL. \\n\\niv) \\n\\nCredit-impaired \\n\\nA financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the \\nestimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset \\nis credit- impaired includes observable data about the following events: \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n\\nSignificant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower; \\nA breach of contract, such as a default or past due event; \\nThe  lender(s)  of  the  borrower,  for  economic  or  contractual  reasons  relating  to  the \\nborrower's  financial  difficulty,  having  granted  to  the  borrower  a  concession(s)  that  the \\nlender(s) would not otherwise consider; \\nIt  is  becoming  probable  that  the  borrower  will  enter  bankruptcy  or  other  financial \\nreorganization; \\nThe  disappearance  of  an  active  market  for  that  financial  asset  because  of  financial \\ndifficulties; or \\nThe purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred \\ncredit losses. \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\nIt may not be possible to identify a single discrete event – instead, the combined effect of several \\nevents may have caused financial assets to become credit-impaired. \\n\\nv) \\n\\nDefinition of default \\n\\nThe  definition  of  default  used  for  determining  the  risk  of  a  default  occurring  shall  be  applied \\nconsistently to all financial instruments unless information becomes available that demonstrates \\nthat another default definition is more appropriate for a particular financial instrument. The Bank's \\ndefinition of default is based on the regulatory definition under Article 178 of the ‘Regulation (EU) \\nNo 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union of 26 June \\n2013 on prudential requirements for credit banks and investment firms and amending Regulation \\n(EU)  648/2012’  (CRR).  A  default  is  considered  to  have  occurred  when  either  of  the  following \\nconditions had taken place. \\n\\n22 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\na. \\n\\nQualitative \\n\\nUnlikeliness to Pay (UTP) criterion: the Bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay \\nits credit obligations to the Bank without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realizing \\nsecurity. Below there are some elements that are taken as indications of unlikeliness to \\npay (in line with CRR (Article 178)). \\n\\n- \\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\nThe Bank puts the credit obligation on non-accrued status. \\nThe  Bank  recognizes  a  specific  credit  adjustment  resulting  from  a  significant \\nperceived  decline  in  credit  quality  subsequent  to  the  institution  taking  on  the \\nexposure. \\nThe Bank has filed for the obligor's bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of an \\nobligor's  credit  obligation  to  the  Bank,  the  parent  undertaking  or  any  of  its \\nsubsidiaries. \\nThe  obligor  has  sought  or  has  been  placed  in  bankruptcy  or  similar  protection \\nwhere this would avoid or delay repayment of a credit obligation to the Bank, the \\nparent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries. \\n\\nb. \\n\\nQuantitative \\n\\nPast due criterion: the exposure is past due more than 90 days on any credit obligation to \\nthe Bank. \\n\\nImpairment losses for guarantees are recognized while a guarantee is in effect and the \\namounts  are  determined  based  on  the  level  of  utilization  of  the  guarantee.  The \\nmethodology is consistent to that of loan commitments, and such losses are included in \\n‘Other liabilities’. \\n\\nInterest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount for financial assets in Stage 1 and 2. \\nAs the primary definition for credit-impaired financial assets moving to Stage 3, the Bank applies \\nthe  definition  of default,  and interest income is calculated on the  net carrying amount for these \\nfinancial assets only. \\n\\nIf the amount of impairment subsequently decreases due to an event occurring after a write-down, \\nthe release (i.e. reverse) of the impairment is credited to the provision for impairment asset losses. \\nUnwinding of the discount is treated as income and remaining provision is then reassessed. \\n\\n3.6.2  Non-financial assets \\n\\nAt each financial position date, the Bank reviews the carrying value of the non-financial assets and \\nassesses whether there  is any indication of impairment. If such indications exist, an analysis is \\nperformed  to  assess  whether  the  book  value  of  the  specific  assets  can  be  recovered.  The \\nrecoverable amount is the higher amount between the fair value less costs of disposal and of \\nthe value in use (as calculated from the net cash flows). If the carrying value of an intangible asset \\nexceeds its recoverable value, then an impairment loss is recorded in the income statement. \\n\\n3.6.3  Renegotiated financial assets \\n\\nWhen necessary, the Bank seeks to restructure a financial asset that may involve extending the \\npayment arrangements and the agreement of new loan terms and conditions. These are generally \\nrenegotiated in response to an adverse change in the financial condition of the borrower. \\n\\n23 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nModifications  occur  when  the  contractual  cash  flows  of  a  financial  asset  are  renegotiated  or \\notherwise  modified.  Some  modifications  result  in  derecognition  of  the  existing  asset  and \\nrecognition of a new asset with the difference recognized as a derecognition gain or loss, to the \\nextent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded, while other modifications do not \\nresult in derecognition. Modifications that result in derecognition are considered to be substantial \\nmodifications. A significant or substantial change is defined when the customer enters into a new \\nloan contract (i.e. completely new product and new pricing) that has a different interest rate type, \\nloan  amount,  term  period  (temporary  term  extension  is  excluded),  and/or  customer  (e.g.  from \\nsingle customer to joint or change in one of the joint customer names). \\n\\nA distressed restructuring is an indication of unlikeliness to pay where this is likely to result in a \\ndiminished financial obligation caused by the material (change in the net present value of the asset \\nby more than 10%) forgiveness, or postponement of either principal, interest or, where relevant \\nfees. Distressed restructuring occurs when forbearance measures have been extended towards a \\ndebtor. Therefore, those forborne exposures where the forbearance measures are likely to result \\nin a diminished financial obligation are classified as defaulted. \\n\\nRestructured operations will be considered cured and normalized after two successful repayments \\n(average of 6 months per repayment) and could therefore be subject to a Stage movement. \\n\\nFor loans that are modified the Bank recalculates the gross book value based on the revised cash \\nflows  on  the  financial  asset  and  recognizes  the  profit  or  loss  from  the  modification  in  income \\nstatement. The new gross book value is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the \\noriginal effective interest rate. \\n\\n3.6.4  Write-offs \\n\\nAccording to the IFRS 9 (B5.4.9), the gross carrying amount of a financial asset may be directly \\nreduced when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the financial asset in its entirety or \\na portion of it. As such, the Bank may record a write-off of Stage 3 loans. The Bank may also, on \\nan ad-hoc basis, examine the need for any further write-offs of Stage 2 loans if there is relevant \\nevidence. \\n\\n3.6.5  Write-backs \\n\\nRecoveries  (write-backs)  of  an  asset,  or  part  thereof,  are  credited  to  the  income  statement  if \\npreviously written off. \\n\\n3.7 \\n\\nFinancial Liabilities \\n\\nThe Bank recognizes a financial liability in its financial statements at the time of the arising from the item \\n(that  is, the  day the transaction took place).  Financial liabilities primarily  include  (a) borrowings  and (b) \\nother liabilities. \\n\\n24 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n3.7.1  Borrowings \\n\\nBorrowing  transactions  which  are  amounts  due  to  financial  institutions  and  debts  evidence  by \\ncertificates,  are  recognized  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  at  the  time  the  funds  are \\ntransferred to the Bank. They are measured initially at the fair value of the funds transferred, less \\nany transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortized cost unless they qualify for \\nhedge  accounting  in  which  case  the  amortized  cost  is  adjusted  for  the  fair  value  movements \\nattributable to the to the risks being hedged. Interest expense is accrued in the income statement \\nwithin “Interest expense” using the effective interest rate method. \\n\\n3.7.2  Other liabilities \\n\\nOther liabilities that are not derivatives or designated at FVTPL, are recorded at amortized cost. \\nThe amounts include accrued finance charges on borrowings and other accounts payable. \\n\\n3.8 \\n\\nOffsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities \\n\\nOffsetting of financial assets and liabilities in the financial statements is permitted if, and only if, there is a \\ncurrently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a \\nnet basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. \\n\\n3.9 \\n\\nDerivatives \\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Bank enters into various types of transactions that involve derivative \\nfinancial instruments. A derivative financial instrument is a financial contract between two parties, where \\nfuture payments are dependent upon movements in price in one or more underlying financial instruments, \\nreference rates or indices. \\n\\nThe Bank primarily makes use of derivatives for the below strategic purposes: \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\nMany of the Bank’s issued securities, excluding commercial paper, are individually paired with a \\nswap to convert the issuance proceeds into the currency and interest rate structure sought by the \\nBank. \\nTo manage the net interest rate risks and foreign exchange risks arising from all financial assets \\nand liabilities. \\nThrough currency swaps, to manage funding requirements for the Bank’s loan portfolio. \\n\\nDerivatives  can  include  interest  rate  and  cross  currency  swaps,  forward  foreign  exchange  contracts, \\ninterest  rate  future  contracts,  and  options  on  interest  rates  and  foreign  currencies.  Such  financial \\ninstruments  are  initially  recognized  in  the  statement  of  financial  position  (SOFP)  at  fair  value  and  are \\nsubsequently measured at their fair value. They are carried in the SOFP as assets when their fair value is \\npositive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. \\n\\nChanges in fair value of derivative financial instruments are included in the income statement. Fair values \\nare obtained from quoted market prices to the extent publicly available, discounted cash flows and options \\npricing models as appropriate. \\n\\nThe Bank enters into  derivatives, to  protect the Bank from financial risks such as currency risk, market \\nprice risk and interest rate risk. Such hedges are entered into to lessen or eliminate economic exposure. \\nThe Bank’s policies on risk management are to not take significant interest rate or foreign exchange risks, \\nand to aim where possible to match assets, liabilities and derivatives. \\n\\nThe majority of the Bank’s lending activities is at floating rates linked to USD Libor or Euribor. When lending \\nat a fixed rate the Bank will often use interest rate swaps to produce floating rate interest payments. \\n\\nThe Bank’s borrowings, particularly bonds issuances, tend to be at a fixed rate and sometimes in currency \\ndenominations other than EUR or USD. The Bank in order mitigate the aforementioned underlying risks \\nuses either interest rate or cross currency interest rate swaps to produce floating rate liabilities in USD or \\nEUR. \\n\\n25 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nAll the Bank’s interest rate or cross currency swaps are explicitly tied to a balance sheet asset or liability. \\nTypically, the fixed rate on the swap and the matching asset or liability have the same characteristics (term, \\npayment dates etc.). \\n\\nForeign  exchange  forwards  (paired  purchases  and  sales  of  currencies  on  different  dates)  of  maturities \\ntypically less than three months are not tied to specific assets or liabilities. These are undertaken to manage \\nsurpluses and shortfalls in EUR and USD and are not undertaken for speculative purposes. All derivatives \\nare documented under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreement \\nwith Credit Swap Annexes (CSAs) and marked to market and cash collateralized daily. The Department of \\nTreasury, under the guidance of ALCO and the supervision of the ALM unit, is responsible for the primary \\nusage and managing interest rate and currency risks in the Bank’s statement of financial position. \\n\\nThe notional amounts and fair values of the derivative instruments are disclosed in Note 14. The fair value \\nhierarchy level of derivatives is disclosed in Note 5. \\n\\n3.9.1 Derivatives and hedge accounting  \\n\\nThe Bank designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency rate \\nand interest rate risk in fair value or cash flow hedges. The bank does not apply fair value hedge \\naccounting  of  portfolio  of  hedges  of  interest  rate  risk.  In  addition,  the  bank  does  not  use  the \\nexception to continue using IAS 39 hedge accounting rules, that is the Bank applies IFRS 9 in full. \\n\\nIn accordance with its wider risk management, as set out in Note 5, when a hedging relationship \\nmeets the specified hedge accounting criteria, it is the Bank’s strategy to apply either fair value or \\ncash  flow  hedges  based  on  the  exposure  being  hedged.  Transactions  that  are  entered  into  in \\naccordance  with  the  Bank’s  hedging  objectives,  but  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting,  are \\nreferred to in these financial statements as economic hedge relationships. \\n\\nAt  the  inception  of  the  hedge  relationship,  the  Bank  formally  documents  how  the  hedging \\nrelationship meets the hedge accounting criteria, by recording the economic relationship between \\nthe hedged item and the hedging instrument, the nature of the risk, the risk management objective \\nand  strategy  for  undertaking  the  hedge  as  well  as  the  method  that  will  be  used  to  assess  the \\neffectiveness of the hedging relationship. Furthermore, both at the inception and on an ongoing \\nbasis (at least on each reporting date or upon significant change, whichever comes first), the Bank \\ndocuments  whether  an  economic  relationship  exists  between  the  hedging  instrument  and  the \\nhedged item. \\n\\nIn order the Bank to apply hedge accounting, the following requirements must be met: \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\nThere  must  be  an  expectation  that  the  fair  value  or  the  cash  flows  of  the  hedging \\ninstrument and the value or the cash flows of the hedged item, will “systematically” change \\nin  response  to  movements  in  the  same  underlying(s)  that  are  economically  related, \\nproviding a degree of offset between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The \\nassessment relates to expectations about hedge effectiveness and is only forward-looking. \\n\\nThe  effect  of  credit  risk  should  not  dominate  the  value  changes  that  result  from  that \\neconomic relationship. \\n\\nThe weightings of the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which define the hedge \\nratio of the hedging relationship, are the same as that resulting from the quantity of the \\nhedged item that the Bank actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that \\nthe Bank actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item. \\n\\nIf a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to \\nthe hedge ratio but the risk management objective for that designated hedging relationship \\nremains  the  same,  the  Bank  adjusts  the  hedge  ratio  of  the  hedging  relationship  by \\nrebalancing the hedge, so that it meets the qualifying criteria again. \\n\\n26 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nFor  the  assessment  of  hedge  effectiveness  requirements  and  when  measuring  the  hedge \\neffectiveness / ineffectiveness, the Bank uses qualitative and supplementary quantitative analysis \\nwhere  applicable.  Sources  of  hedge  ineffectiveness  between  the  hedged  items  and  hedging \\ninstruments, can arise from: \\n\\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n\\nDifferences in timing of cash flows. \\nDifferent applied discount interest rate curves. \\nNon-nil fair value of derivatives at the designation date. \\nThe effect of changes in counterparties’ credit risk on the fair values. \\n\\nThe Bank discontinues hedge accounting prospectively only when the hedging relationship (or a \\npart thereof) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after rebalancing, if applicable) or the hedging \\ninstrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. \\n\\nThe  notional  amounts  and  fair  values  of  the  derivative  instruments  designated  are  disclosed \\nseparately in Note 14. Hedge accounting disclosures are provided in Note 5. \\n\\n3.9.1.1 Fair value hedges \\n\\nApplying fair value hedge accounting enables the Bank to reduce fair value fluctuations of \\nthe recognized fixed rate financial liabilities as if they were floating rate instruments linked \\nto  the  attributable  benchmark  rates,  thus  hedging  the  exposure  that  is  attributable  to \\ninterest rate risk/foreign currency risk and could affect reported earnings. \\n\\nThe Bank only hedges changes due to interest rates, such as benchmark rates, which are \\ntypically  the  most  significant  component  of  the  overall  fair  value  change.  The  Bank \\nassesses  hedge  effectiveness  by  comparing  fair  value  movements  of  the  hedging \\ninstruments and the hedged items attributable to changes in these benchmark rates. \\n\\nFor  designated  and  qualifying  fair  value  hedges,  the  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the \\nqualifying hedging instruments is recognized in profit or loss whereas the carrying value \\nof a hedged item that is not already measured at fair value, is adjusted for the fair value \\nchange attributable to the hedged risk in the statement of financial position (“'Borrowings”'), \\nwith  a  corresponding  entry  in  profit  or  loss.  The  Bank  recognizes  the  hedging  gains  or \\nlosses from the hedging instrument in profit or loss, in the same line as the adjustment for \\nthe hedged item (“net  fair  value  gains (losses) on derivative instruments”). Accordingly, \\nany ineffective part is recognized immediately in profit or loss. \\n\\nUpon  discontinuation  of  hedge  accounting,  the  fair  value  adjustment  to  the  carrying \\namount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk, is amortized to profit or loss from \\nthat  date,  based  on  how  the  hedged  item  impacts  profit  or  loss.  If  the  hedged  item  is \\nderecognized,  the  unamortized  fair  value  hedge  adjustment  included  in  the  carrying \\namount of the hedged item is recognized immediately in profit or loss. \\n\\n3.9.1.2 Cash flow hedges \\n\\nApplying cash flow hedge accounting, the Bank hedges the exposure to the variability in \\ncash flows attributable to interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk associated with a \\nrecognized liability that could affect reported earnings. \\n\\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in Other \\nComprehensive Income (OCI) and presented in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity \\n(“Cash Flow Hedge Reserve”), whereas any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value \\nof the derivative is recognized immediately in profit or loss (“Unrealized net fair value gains \\n(losses) on derivative instruments”). \\n\\n27 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nThe amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is limited to the cumulative fair \\nvalue hedge of the hedged item from the inception of the Hedge less any amounts recycled \\nto profit or loss. \\n\\nFor assessing the hedge effectiveness, the  hypothetical derivative approach is applied, \\nwhich  involves  establishing  a  notional  derivative  that  would  be  the  ideal  hedging \\ninstrument for the hedged  exposure (i.e. swap with  a zero fair value at inception of the \\nhedge relationship with the same critical terms as the hedged items) and then use as a \\nproxy  for  measuring  hedge  effectiveness,  the  comparison  between  the  cumulative \\nchanges  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hypothetical  derivative  and  the  fair  value  of  the  actual \\nhedging instrument. \\n\\nProvided  that  the  hedged  cash  flows  are  no  longer  expected  to  occur,  then  the  Bank \\nimmediately reclassifies the amount in the cash flow hedge reserve from OCI to profit or \\nloss, however on hedge discontinuations, if the hedged cash flows are still  expected to \\noccur, then the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is not reclassified until \\nthe hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. \\n\\n3.10 \\n\\nFinancial Guarantees \\n\\nIssued financial guarantees are initially recognized at their fair value, being the premium (fee) received and \\nsubsequently measured at the higher of the unamortized balance of the related fees received and deferred, \\nand the expenditure required to settle the commitment at the financial position date. The latter is recognized \\nwhen it is both probable that the guarantee will require to be settled and that the settlement amount can \\nbe reliably estimated. Financial guarantees are recognized within other financial assets and other financial \\nliabilities. \\n\\n3.11 \\n\\nProperty and Equipment \\n\\nProperty  and  equipment  include  leasehold  improvements  and  transportation  and  other  equipment. \\nProperty and equipment are initially recorded at cost, which includes all costs that are required to bring an \\nasset into operating condition. Subsequently to initial recognition, property and equipment are measured \\nat cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. \\n\\nCosts incurred subsequently to the acquisition of an asset, which is classified as property and equipment \\nare capitalized, only when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Bank beyond \\nthose originally anticipated for the asset, otherwise they are expensed as incurred. \\n\\nAt  each  reporting  date  the  Bank  assesses  whether  there  is  any  indication  that  an  item  of  property  and \\nequipment may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Bank estimates the recoverable amount of \\nthe asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is \\nwritten  down  immediately  to  its  recoverable  amount.  Gains  and  losses  on  disposal  of  property  and \\nequipment are determined by reference to their carrying amount and are taken into account in determining \\nnet income or loss. \\n\\nDepreciation is provided to write off the cost of each asset to their residual values on a straight-line basis \\nover their estimated useful lives. The annual depreciation rates applied were as follows: \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n\\nExpenditure on leasehold buildings and improvements are \\ndepreciated over the remaining term of the lease \\nTransportation vehicles \\nFurniture and office accessories \\nPersonal computers \\nOffice and telecommunication equipment \\n\\n- \\n20.0% \\n20.0% \\n33.3% \\n20.0% \\n\\n28 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n3.12 \\n\\nIntangible Assets \\n\\nIntangible assets comprise software expenditures and other intangible assets. These assets are amortized \\non a straight-line basis over the best estimate of their useful lives, which is software for desktops of three \\nyears and software for servers of five years. At each reporting date, management reviews intangible assets \\nand  assesses  whether  there  is  any  indication  of  impairment.  If  such  indications  exist  an  analysis  is \\nperformed to assess whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is fully recoverable. A write-down is \\nmade if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. \\n\\n3.13  Right of Use Assets \\n\\nRight-of-use  assets  comprise  those  assets  that  the  Bank,  as  the  lessee,  has  control  of  the  underlying \\nassets during the term of the lease. Control is considered to exist if the Bank has: \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\nThe right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified \\nasset; and \\nThe right to direct the use of that asset. \\n\\nThe  Bank  provides  for  the  recognition  of  a  right-of-use  asset  and  a  lease  liability  upon  lease \\ncommencement in case that there is a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys to the Bank the right to \\nuse an asset for a period of time in exchange for a consideration. More details are provided within the lease \\naccounting policy Note 3.21. \\n\\n3.14 \\n\\nTaxation \\n\\nIn accordance with Article 52 of the Establishing Agreement, the Bank, its assets, property, income and its \\noperations and transactions are exempt from all taxation and all customs duties in all Member Countries.  \\n\\nThe Bank is also exempt from any obligation for payment, withholding or collection of any tax or duty. Also, \\nno tax shall be levied on salaries or emoluments paid by the Bank to employees. These tax exemptions \\nare  also  included  and  elaborated  upon  in  Article  12  of  the  Headquarters  Agreement  with  the  Hellenic \\nGovernment, ratified by Greek Law 2380/No.38/7.3.1996. \\n\\n3.15 \\n\\nProvisions \\n\\nThe Bank records provisions for present obligations and risks when the following circumstances exist (a) \\nthere is an existing legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events (b) for the obligation to be \\nsettled an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is present and (c) a reliable estimate of the \\namount of the obligation can be made. \\n\\n3.16 \\n\\nShare Capital and Dividends \\n\\nIn  accordance  with  Article  36  of  the  Establishing  Agreement,  the  Board  of  Governors  shall  determine \\nannually what part of net income or surplus of the Bank from operations shall be allocated to reserves, \\nprovided that no part of the net income or surplus of the Bank shall be distributed to members by way of \\nprofit until the general reserves of the Bank shall have attained the level of 10% of the subscribed capital \\nincluding all paid, unpaid but payable, and unpaid but callable share capital. \\n\\n3.17  Reserves and Retained Earnings \\n\\nIn accordance with the Establishing Agreement of the Bank the general reserve is created from the profits \\nof the Bank for meeting any unforeseeable risks or contingencies. The revaluation reserve represents the \\naccumulated change in fair value of those financial assets that are measured at fair value through other \\ncomprehensive income of the Bank. The retained earnings of the Bank is the accumulated undistributed \\nand unallocated net income over the years. \\n\\n29 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n3.18 \\n\\nIncome and Expense \\n\\nInterest income and expense are recognized in the income statement using the effective interest method. \\nThe  effective  interest  rate  (EIR)  is  the  rate  that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future  cash  payments  or \\nreceipts through the expected life of the financial instrument (or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to: \\n\\n- \\n- \\n\\nThe gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or \\nThe amortized cost of the financial liability. \\n\\nWhen  calculating  the  EIR  for  financial  instruments  other  than  purchased  or  originated  credit-impaired \\nassets the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, \\nbut  not  the  ECL.  For  purchased  or  originated  credit-impaired  financial  assets,  a  credit-adjusted  EIR  is \\ncalculated using estimated future cash flows including the ECL. \\n\\nThe calculation of the EIR includes transaction costs and fees paid or received that are an integral part of \\nthe effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the \\nacquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability. \\n\\ni) \\n\\nAmortized cost (AC) and gross carrying amount \\n\\nThe AC of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial \\nliability  is  measured  on  initial  recognition  minus  the  principal  repayments,  plus  or  minus  the \\ncumulative amortization using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial \\namount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any  ECL allowance. The \\ngross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the AC of a financial asset before adjusting for any \\nECL allowance. \\n\\nii) \\n\\nCalculation of interest income and expense \\n\\nInterest  income  and  expense  are  recognized  in  the  income  statement  for  all  interest  bearing \\ninstruments using the effective interest rate method. Interest income includes interest on loans and \\nadvances  to  customers,  coupons  earned  on  fixed  income  investment  securities  and  accrued \\ndiscount and premium on treasury bills and other instruments. \\n\\nFees and direct costs relating to a loan origination or acquiring an investment security, financing \\nor restructuring and to loan commitments are deferred and amortized to interest income over the \\nlife of the instrument using the effective interest rate method. \\n\\nOnce a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of \\nan impairment loss, interest income is recognized using the rate of interest used to discount the \\nfuture cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. \\n\\nThe EIR of a financial asset or financial  liability is calculated on  initial recognition of  a financial \\nasset or a financial liability. In calculating interest income and expense, the EIR is applied to the \\ngross  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  (when  the  asset  is  not  credit-impaired)  or  to  the  AC  of  the \\nliability.  The  EIR  is  revised  as  a  result  of  periodic  re-estimation  of  cash  flows  of  floating  rate \\ninstruments to reflect movements in market rates of interest. \\n\\nHowever, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, \\ninterest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the net balance of the financial \\nasset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to \\nthe gross basis. \\n\\nFor financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated \\nby  applying  the  credit-adjusted  EIR  to  the  AC  of  the  financial  asset.  The  calculation  of  interest \\nincome does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the financial asset improves. \\n\\nOther  interest  income/expense  includes  interest  on  derivatives  in  economic  hedge  using  the \\ncontractual interest rate. \\n\\n30 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\niii) \\n\\nFees and commissions \\n\\nFee  and  commission  income  and  expense  that  are  integral  to  the  EIR  on  a  financial  asset  or \\nfinancial liability are included in the EIR. Other fee and commission income  – including account \\nservicing fees, investment management fees, sales commission, placement fees and syndication \\nfees – is recognized as the related services are performed. If a loan commitment is not expected \\nto  result  in  the  draw-down  of  a  loan,  then  the  related  loan  commitment  fee  is  recognized  on  a \\nstraight-line basis over the commitment period. \\n\\nA contract with a customer that results in a recognized financial instrument in the Bank’s financial \\nstatements may be partially in the scope of IFRS 9 and partially in the scope of IFRS 15. If this is \\nthe case, then the Bank first applies IFRS 9 to separate and measure the part of the contract that \\nis in the scope of IFRS 9 and then applies IFRS 15 to the residual. \\n\\nFee  and  commission  income  from  contracts  with  customers  under  the  scope  of  IFRS  15  is \\nmeasured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Bank recognizes \\nrevenue when it transfers control over a service to a customer. The adoption of IFRS 15 had no \\nimpact  on  the  Bank’s  financial  statements  as  the  execution  and  completion  of  the  transaction \\nrequested by a customer is done at point in time, and this is consistent with the Bank’s existing \\naccounting policy. \\n\\nOther  fee  and  commission  expenses  relate  mainly  to  transaction  and  service  fees,  which  are \\nexpensed as the services are received. \\n\\niv) \\n\\nInterest rate benchmark reform \\n\\nAt present the Bank is continuing the usage of Libor as the interest rate benchmark of which the \\nBank is exposed to, as there is uncertainty to the timing and precise form of the new benchmark \\nthat has yet to be finalized. The adoption will not have any material impact on the Bank’s financial \\nstatements. \\n\\n3.19 \\n\\nStaff Retirement and Termination Benefits \\n\\nThe Bank has established a pension plan, where the fund’s assets are held separately from the  Bank’s \\nown assets, for all its eligible employees, consisting of three pillars: \\n\\na. \\n\\nThe first pillar is a defined post-employment benefit scheme financed entirely by the Bank. \\nThe scheme’s funding level and the Bank’s contributions are determined on the basis of \\nactuarial valuations performed by qualified, independent actuaries on an annual basis at \\nthe end of each annual reporting period. The actuarial valuation uses the projected unit \\ncredit  method  and  a  number  of  financial  and  demographic  assumptions.  The  most \\nsignificant assumptions include age, years of service  or compensation, life  expectancy, \\nthe discount rate, expected salary increases and pension rates. The actuarial liability is \\nthe present value of the defined benefit obligation as at the reporting date minus the fair \\nvalue of the plan assets. The Bank is under the obligation to maintain the scheme fully \\nfunded, and to this effect, has always liquidated any past service deficit over the course of \\nthe year following the relevant actuarial valuation. \\n\\nActuarial and asset gains or losses are recognized in ‘Other comprehensive income’, and \\nnet gains or losses are included in remeasurements where any change in the effect of the \\nasset  ceiling,  excluding  those  amounts  that  have  been  already  included  in  personnel \\nexpenses, are also included. \\n\\nb. \\n\\nThe  second  pillar  is  a  defined  post-employment  contribution  scheme  to  which  both  the \\nemployee and the Bank contribute equally at a rate of 0-12% of basic salary. The Bank \\nhas no obligation to pay further contribution if the employee discontinues their contribution.  \\nEach employee  determines his/her contribution rate  and the mode  of investment of the \\ncontributions. \\n\\n31 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nc. \\n\\nThe third pillar is a defined contribution scheme funded entirely by each employee, up to \\n40% of basic salary and is not recorded in the Bank’s financial statements. \\n\\nAs  an  alternative,  staff  are  entitled  to  retirement  benefits  from  the  Greek  State  Social  Insurance  Fund \\n(EFKA), which is a defined contribution scheme. \\n\\nCurrent  service  costs  in  respect  of  both  the  pension  plan  (a)  and  (b)  and  EFKA  are  recognized  as  an \\nexpense in the period which they relate and are included in ‘Personnel expenses’. \\n\\nThe Bank may offer termination benefits to employees that are separated based on the Bank’s separation \\npolicy. These benefits, including indemnities and any related retirement benefits, are recognized in income \\nas an expense in the same period they are incurred. \\n\\n3.20  Related Parties \\n\\nRelated parties include entities, which the Bank has the ability to exercise significant influence in making \\nfinancial and operational decisions. Related parities include key management personnel, and close family \\nmembers of key management personnel. \\n\\n3.21 \\n\\nLeases – the Bank as a Lessee \\n\\nOn 1 January 2019 the Bank adopted IFRS 16, ‘Leases’.  This Standard has established the principles for \\nthe recognition, measurement and presentation of leases, and provides a single lessee accounting model \\nthat  is  required  at  the  commencement  date  of  the  lease.  The  objective  is  to  report  information  that  (a) \\nfaithfully represents lease transactions and (b) provides a basis for the amount, timing and uncertainty of \\ncash  flows  arising  from  leases.  The  Bank  as  a  lessee  is  required  to  recognize  right-of-use  assets \\n(representing the Bank’s right to use the underlying leased assets) and a lease liability (representing the \\nBank’s obligation to make lease payments), in the statement of financial position. \\n\\nThe Bank applied the practical expedient in IFRS 16 to contracts that were identified as leases in order to \\ndetermine  whether  an  arrangement  contains  a  lease,  on  transition  to  contracts  that  were  previously \\nidentified as leases under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. Consequently, the Bank’s leases are only for office space; \\nand does not lease land, corporate vehicles, or technical or IT equipment, nor does  the Bank have any \\nsale-and-leaseback transactions. The Bank elected to apply the modified retrospective transition approach, \\nwithout restatement of comparative figures. Under this approach, the Bank was able to choose on a lease \\nby lease basis to measure the right-of-use asset at the same amount as the lease liability. \\n\\nThe Bank’s leases for right-of-use assets are initially recognized and measured at cost similarly to other \\nnon-financial  assets,  and  the  lease  liability  is  initially  recognized  and  measured  at  the  present  value  of \\nfuture lease payments that are not paid at that date similarly to other financial liabilities. The lease payments \\ncan be discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if such is available, or alternatively the Bank’s \\nincremental borrowing rate. The Bank will apply this measurement – except for those with lease term of 12 \\nmonths  or  less,  making  use  of  the  shot-term  leases  and  leases  of  low  value,  exemptions  under  this \\nStandard. \\n\\nRegarding  subsequent  measurement,  the  Bank  acting  as  a  lessee,  has  applied  the  cost  model  for  the \\nmeasurement  of  the  right-of-use  asset;  where  this  asset  is  measured  at  cost,  less  any  accumulated \\ndepreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for the remeasurement of the lease \\nliability. The lease liability is measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect any interest on it and \\nthat is separately recognized as an expense; the lease liability’s carrying amount is reduced to reflect the \\nlease payments made. In case of any reassessments (e.g. a change in future lease payments resulting \\nfrom a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments) or lease modifications (e.g. a change \\nin the lease term, lease conditions or any penalty) specified, the carrying amount of the lease liability will \\nbe remeasured to reflect revised lease payments. \\n\\n32 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n4. \\nUNCERTAINTY \\n\\nSIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  JUDGEMENTS  AND  KEY  SOURCES  OF  ESTIMATION \\n\\nThe preparation of the Bank’s financial statements requires Management to make judgements, estimates \\nand  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  income  and  expense  and \\naccompanying notes. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that \\nrequire a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities affected in future periods. The \\nBank  believes  that  the  significant  judgments,  estimates  and  assumptions  used  in  the  preparation  of  its \\ncondensed interim financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances as of the date of \\npreparation.  The  most  significant  areas,  for  which  critical  judgments,  estimates  and  assumptions  are \\nrequired in applying the Bank’s accounting policies, are the following: \\n\\na. \\n\\nb. \\n\\nFair value estimates for financials instruments carried at fair value.  \\n\\nThe Bank’s method for determining the level of impairment of loan operations is described \\nwithin  the  Accounting  and  further  explained  in  Note  5  Risk  Management  –  credit  risk \\nsection. In accordance with IFRS 9, ECL represents the average credit losses weighted \\nby the probabilities of default (PD), whereby credit losses are defined as the present value \\nof all cash shortfalls. The ECL is calculated for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 loans by applying \\nthe provision rate to the projected exposure at default (EAD), and discounting the resulting \\nprovision using the loan’s effective interest rate (EIR). The provision rate is generated by \\nmultiplying the PD rate and the loss given default (LGD) rate applicable to the loan. \\n\\nA  number  of  critical  accounting  estimates  are  therefore  made  in  the  calculation  of \\nimpairment of loan operations as follows: \\n\\n• \\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nCriteria used for staging assessment of loans and advances to customers. \\nAssumptions  for  future  cashflows  of  individually  assessed  credit-impaired \\nexposures. \\nThe  input  and  assumptions  used  to  estimate  the  impact  of  multiple  economic \\nscenarios. \\n\\nFor loans  that are individually assessed which have  a lifetime  ECL and that  are credit-\\nimpaired  in  Stage  3,  the  impairment  allowance  results  from  the  impairment  test  that  is \\nconducted on the basis of objective evidence obtained through a risk asset review process. \\nAn  impairment  test  includes  projected  cash  in-flows  and  out-flows,  available  for  debt \\nservice until maturity, which are discounted at the original effective interest rate (EIR) to \\nreach a net present value for a particular operation, less any collateral that can be realized. \\n\\n33 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n4.1 \\n\\nCovid-19 \\n\\nThe continuation of the Covid-19 pandemic means that the Bank could face additional credit, market and \\noperational  risks.  The  duration  of  the  pandemic  is  difficult  to  predict  at  this  time,  as  are  the  extent  and \\neffectiveness of economic interventions by the governments and central banks in the region of the Bank’s \\noperations. The Bank continues to monitor the developments and to manage the risks associated with the \\nBank’s various portfolios within existing financial policies and constraints. The two main areas that affect \\nthe Bank’s judgement and estimates are: \\n\\n1. \\n\\n2. \\n\\nThe  Bank’s  equity  investments  which  will  likely  see  a  reduced  fair  value  due  to  the \\ndownward  pressure,  although  the  Bank  has  a  small  portfolio  such  investments,  and \\ntherefore the Bank’s profitability will not be materially impacted. \\n\\nThe Bank’s loan portfolio due to business disruption that can occur in economic activity in \\nthe region will put pressure for borrowers, affecting those operating primarily in the service \\nand consumer goods industries. This could likely force debt restructuring and an increase \\nin defaults among less robust operations. The Bank’s profitability could be impacted by a \\nsevere increase in ECL on performing loans, driven by worsening of the macro-economic \\noutlook scenarios. \\n\\nWith regard of the Bank’s operational risk the information technology (IT) systems have proven they are \\nstable, powerful and flexible, as the majority of the Bank’s staff were working successfully remotely. The \\nBank  is  also  investing  in  new  IT  infrastructure  to  expand  digital  and  cloud  transformation,  as  well  as \\nstrengthening the Bank’s cybersecurity and internal control systems. \\n\\n34 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n5. \\n\\nRISK MANAGEMENT \\n\\nThe  Bank’s  activities  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  risks,  some  of  which  are  not  within  the  Bank’s  control: \\nincluding  risks  relating  to  changes  in  interest  rates,  foreign  exchange  rates,  declines  in  liquidity  and \\ndeterioration in the credit quality of its loan portfolio. The Bank monitors and manages the maturities of its \\nloans,  its  interest  rate  and  exchange  rate  exposure,  its  liquidity  position  and  the  credit  quality  of  each \\nindividual loan and equity investment in order to minimize the effects of changes in them relative to the \\nBank’s profitability and liquidity position. The BoD has approved risk management policies and guidelines \\nthat are delegated to the Management of the Bank for the identification and measurement of risk, as well \\nas being subject to risk limits and controls. \\n\\nTo manage risks the Bank has established an Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO), a Credit Committee \\n(CC)  that  implement  the  Bank’s  credit  and  lending  policies,  the  Legal  Affairs  Department,  the  Risk \\nManagement  Department  and  the  Financial  Analysis  Department,  which  together  are  responsible  for \\ndevising, implementing and monitoring the Bank’s risk management policies, including financial, credit and \\nmarket risks. \\n\\nThe  ALCO  is  responsible  for  monitoring  and  managing  the  Bank’s  overall  asset  and  liability  position  in \\naccordance  with  the  Bank’s  treasury  policies.  It  monitors  and  manages  the  Bank’s  liquidity  position, \\nmaturity gaps, interest income and expense and the condition of the international financial markets and is \\nresponsible for assigning market risk limits. The ALCO consists of members of the Bank’s Management \\nand a member of the Treasury Department and has regular monthly meetings. \\n\\nThe Credit Committee is responsible with respect to credit matters. Its key responsibilities include: approval \\nof lending operations for submission to the BoD for final approval, establishing specific parameters (e.g. \\npolicies, limits, targets, guidelines) for operational decision-making, approval of changes to the manuals \\nthat prescribe how operations are to be analyzed, approved, administered and monitored and approval of \\nany  amendments,  restructuring  and  other  operation-related  matters.  The  Credit  Committee  consists  of \\nmembers of the Bank’s Management, and has regular meetings as required to monitor and manage overall \\nrisk concentration by reference to borrower and industry exposure and critically reviews each individual \\nloan and equity investment proposal made by the lending business areas. A major function of the Credit \\nCommittee is to minimize the credit risk presented by each individual loan and equity investment proposal, \\nand the overall portfolio risk of the Bank. \\n\\nOnce  an  operation  is  approved  and  disbursed,  it  is  then  monitored  to  ensure  thorough  and  regular \\nevaluations of its credit quality. Operations are monitored according to a schedule coordinated by the of \\nProject  Implementation  and  Monitoring  Department,  with  inputs  from  the  originating  Operation  Teams \\nregarding  the  availability  of  financial  data.  Monitoring  reports  are  completed  by  the  Bank’s  Project \\nImplementation and Monitoring Department based on financial analysis prepared by the Financial Analysis \\nDepartment. Risk asset reviews, based on the previously mentioned monitoring reports, are performed by \\nthe Risk Management Department, and may result  in a downgrade  or upgrade  of an operation’s status \\nand, if a significant deterioration is noted, trigger an impairment test. \\n\\nShould  an  operation  display  signs  of  weakness  during  the  regular  monitoring  and/or  through  risk  asset \\nreviews,  an  impairment  test  is  immediately  carried  out  by  the  Risk  Management  Department  and \\nappropriate  remedial  actions  are  taken,  as  required.  These  measures  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  a \\ndetailed assessment of the financial and operational performance of the operation, additional due diligence, \\nstopping disbursement of any undisbursed amounts, preparation of remedial strategies and carrying out \\nfurther impairment tests. Besides, in addition to regular site visits carried out by the Operations Teams, \\nsuch  a  visit  can  be  conducted  by  the  Project  Implementation  and  Monitoring  Department  and,  when \\nappropriate, accompanied by the Financial Analysis Department. \\n\\n35 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nFor the Bank a conservative approach to risk taking together with effective risk management, are critical \\nto  the  Bank’s  continuing  operations.  The  application  of  sound  banking  principles  in  the  Bank’s  credit \\nprocess seeks to ensure that the significant credit risks are properly identified and managed while other \\nrisks resulting from its activities are mitigated to the extent possible. \\n\\nImportantly,  the  Bank  is  recognized  as  an  international  financial  institution,  and  as  such  can  expect  to \\nbenefit  from  the  preferred  creditor  status  customarily  and  historically  afforded  to  such  institutions.  This \\npreferred creditor status serves to provide an additional layer of comfort against the risks of non-payment \\non sovereign debt or by private sector borrowers as a result of local laws creating a delay or freeze on \\nforeign-currency exchanges. The Bank is exposed to the following risks discussed below. \\n\\nFinancial Risk \\n\\nThe Bank’s exposure to financial risk is through its financial assets and financial liabilities including any \\nreceivables from these financial assets. The key aspects of the Bank’s financial risk are (i) credit risk (ii) \\nliquidity risk and (iii) market risk. \\n\\na) \\n\\nCredit risk \\n\\nThe Bank is subject to credit risk, which is the risk that customers or counterparties will be unable to meet \\ntheir obligations as they fall due. Credit risk arises principally from the Bank’s lending activities as well as \\nother activities where the Bank is exposed to counterparty default risk. Regular reviews by the departments \\nof Risk Management, Financial Analysis and Project Implementation and Monitoring are conducted of all \\nexposures  within  the  lending  portfolios,  typically  on  a  semi-annual  basis,  though  exposures  that  are \\nperceived to be more vulnerable to possible default are reviewed more frequently. \\n\\nAt each review there is (i) an assessment of whether there has been any change in the risk profile of the \\nexposure (ii) recommendations of actions to mitigate risk and (iii) reconfirming or adjusting the risk ratings, \\nand for equity investments, reviewing of fair value. Where relevant, the level of the expected credit loss is \\nevaluated and reconfirmed or adjusted. Responsibility for operations considered to be in jeopardy may be \\ntransferred from the original lending department to a corporate recovery team in order to most effectively \\nmanage the restructuring and recovery process. \\n\\nFor  credit  risks  incurred  by  the  Bank’s  Treasury  in  its  investment  and  hedging  activities,  the  BoD  has \\napproved policies and guidelines for the determination of counterparty and investment exposure limits in \\nbonds,  that  includes  member  state  bonds,  and  euro  commercial  paper.  The  Bank’s  Risk  Management \\nDepartment assigns and monitors these counterparty and issuer credit risk limits. Treasury credit risks are \\nalso reviewed on a regular basis by the Bank’s ALCO. \\n\\nThe  table  below  summarizes  the  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  without  taking  into  consideration

The BoD approved guidelines for taking security under lending operations, \\nset the levels and types of collateral and other credit enhancements recommended for a given risk \\nprofile. \\n\\nThe main types of collateral that may be obtained by the Bank are: mortgages on properties and \\nequipment, pledges of equity shares and investment instruments, assignment of rights on certain \\ncontracts,  cash  or  blocked  deposits  and  other  third  party  guarantees.  If  necessary,  the  Bank \\nreassesses  the  value  of  collateral  in  order  to  determine  if  additional  collateral  is  needed  to  be \\nprovided by the borrower. At 31 December 2021 the secured portfolio was 55.8% (2020: 53.9%) \\nof the outstanding loans balance. \\n\\nOther financial instruments. Collateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and \\nadvances is determined by the nature of the instrument. Bonds and euro commercial paper held \\nby  the  Bank  as  investment  securities  are  generally  unsecured.  The  Bank  may  hold  cash  or \\ngovernment securities as collateral against its derivative contract counterparties. At 31 December \\n2021 the Bank had pledged as collateral for derivative transactions a net amount of EUR 14,150 \\nthousand (2020: EUR 3,320 thousand). \\n\\nFor loans that are credit-impaired at the reporting date the Bank has collateral held as security, an \\namount of EUR 38,864 thousand to mitigate credit risk. The types of collateral with approximate \\nvalues are real estate EUR 21,782 thousand, machinery and equipment EUR 6,175 thousand, and \\npledged shares EUR 10,907 thousand. \\n\\nb) \\n\\n Liquidity risk \\n\\nLiquidity  risk  arises  in  the  general  funding  of  the  Bank’s  financing  and  investment  activities  and  in  the \\nmanagement of positions. It concerns the ability of the Bank to fulfill its financial obligations as they become \\ndue  and  is  a  measure  of  the  extent  to  which  the  Bank  may  require  funds  to  meet  those  obligations.  It \\ninvolves both the risk of unexpected increases in the cost of funding the portfolio of assets at appropriate \\nmaturities and rates and the risk of being unable to liquidate a position in a timely manner on reasonable \\nterms. \\n\\nThe  Bank’s  liquidity  policy  aims  to  balance  the  term  and  currency  structure  of  the  Bank’s  assets  and \\nliabilities. Liquidity management is concentrated on the timing of cash in-flows and out-flows, as well as \\nthe adequacy of available cash and liquid securities. The Bank maintains liquid assets at prudential levels \\nto  ensure  that  cash  can  quickly  be  made  available  to  honor  all  its  obligations,  even  under  adverse \\nconditions  and  that  the  Bank  has  access  to  the  funds  necessary  to  satisfy  customer  needs,  maturing \\nliabilities and its own working capital requirements. For this, the Bank estimates all expected cash flows \\nfrom assets and liabilities. \\n\\nThe Bank takes into consideration, to the extent feasible, the guidance documents issued by the Basel \\nCommittee  on  Banking  Supervision.  The  Bank  sets  limits  to  control  its  liquidity  risk  exposure  and \\nvulnerabilities and regularly reviews such limits. The limit framework includes also measures ensuring that \\nin a period of market stress, available liquidity exceeds liquidity needs so that the Bank can continue to \\noperate. \\n\\n41 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nThe Bank’s commitment to maintaining a strong liquidity position is established in policies approved by the \\nBoD.  The liquidity policy requires that the Bank maintain its liquidity position at a minimum of 50% of the \\nfollowing  12 months’  net  cash  requirement,  including  committed  undisbursed  project  and  trade  finance \\nloans. \\n\\nThe  Bank’s  liquidity  position  is  monitored  regularly,  and  the  ALCO  is  primarily  responsible  for  the \\nmanagement of liquidity risk and the liquidity profile of the Bank. The Bank’s liquid assets are maintained \\nin short-term and negotiable securities that primarily are: (i) cash and bank balances (ii) short term deposits  \\nwith investment grade rated counterparties (iii) Euro-denominated commercial paper issued by investment \\ngrade parties and (iv) investment grade bonds. \\n\\nThe table below presents the maturity profile of the undiscounted cash flows for financial liabilities placed \\nbased on the remaining period from the financial position date to the contractual maturity date. It indicates \\nthe earliest maturity dates that the Bank’s counterparties have the ability to demand repayment. \\n\\nThe figures represent undiscounted cash flows (except for  derivatives liabilities), and include estimated \\ninterest amounts, and therefore do not match to the statement of financial position. \\n\\nContractual maturities for financial liabilities at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 were: \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000) \\n\\nBorrowings \\nDerivative financial instruments \\nOther and lease liabilities \\nFinancial Liabilities at 31 December 2021 \\n\\nBorrowings \\nDerivative financial instruments \\nOther and lease liabilities \\nFinancial Liabilities at 31 December 2020 \\n\\nUp to 1 \\nmonth \\n\\n22,073 \\n- \\n- \\n22,073 \\n\\n18,223 \\n- \\n- \\n18,223 \\n\\nFrom 1 \\nmonth to 3 \\nmonths \\n\\nFrom 3 \\nmonths to \\n1 year \\n\\nFrom 1 \\nyear to \\n5 years \\n\\n60,808 \\n1,854 \\n1,616 \\n64,278 \\n\\n60,944 \\n- \\n1,513 \\n62,457 \\n\\n330,493 \\n3,087 \\n8,684 \\n342,264 \\n\\n555,212 \\n12,540 \\n10,229 \\n577,981 \\n\\n1,371,971 \\n14,732 \\n- \\n1,386,703 \\n\\n1,167,718 \\n1,514 \\n- \\n1,169,232 \\n\\nOver 5 \\nyears \\n\\n690,781 \\n26,196 \\n- \\n716,977 \\n\\n229,256 \\n14,881 \\n- \\n244,137 \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n2,476,126 \\n45,869 \\n10,300 \\n2,532,295 \\n\\n2,031,353 \\n28,935 \\n11,742 \\n2,072,030 \\n\\nFor the Bank’s financial assets, the majority mature from one year and over taking into consideration the \\nlatest possible repayment date. \\n\\nc) \\n\\nMarket Risk \\n\\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates or market  prices of financial \\ninstruments may result in losses to the Bank. Market risk arises on such instruments that are valued at \\ncurrent market prices (mark to market basis) or those valued at cost plus any accrued interest (accruals \\nbasis). \\n\\nThe Bank funds its operations by using the Bank’s own share capital and by borrowing on the international \\ncapital  markets.  The  Bank  aims  to  match,  wherever  possible,  the  currencies,  tenors  and  interest  rate \\ncharacteristics  of  its  borrowings  with  those  of  its  lending  portfolios.  When  necessary,  the  Bank  uses \\nderivative instruments to reduce its exposure to exchange rate and interest rate risks. \\n\\nThe  Board  has  approved  risk  management  policies  and  limits  within  which  exposure  to  market  risk  is \\nmonitored, measured and controlled. The ALCO monitors and manages these risks while the asset and \\nliability function within the Treasury  Department has primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with \\nthese policies and limits. \\n\\nc1. \\n\\nForeign exchange risk \\n\\nThe Bank’s risk management policies seek to minimize currency exposures or any unanticipated changes, \\nfavorable or unfavorable, in foreign exchange rates that could affect the income statement, by requiring \\nnet liabilities in any one currency to be matched closely with net assets in the same currency. The Bank \\nwill not take discretionary currency positions. This is achieved primarily by holding or lending the proceeds \\nof the Bank’s borrowings in the currencies in which they were borrowed. \\n\\n42 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nThe Bank regularly monitors its assets and liabilities in order to ensure the Bank takes no significant foreign \\nexchange  risks  and,  after  swap  activities,  adjusts  the  net  asset  currency  composition  to  the  Bank’s \\nfunctional currency to maintain a matched foreign exchange position. As a matter of policy, the Bank aims \\nto keep foreign exchange exposure as close to zero as possible, with exceptions to this practice requiring \\napproval from the ALCO. For local currency transactions the Bank matches the operation’s currency with \\nborrowings  in  the  same  currency,  as  such  there  is  no  material  exposure.  The  tables  below  provide  a \\ncurrency breakdown of the Bank’s assets and liabilities, showing that the effect of any currency fluctuations \\non the net exposure is minimal. \\n\\nAt 31 December 2021 \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000) \\nAssets \\n     Cash and due from banks \\n     Deposits in margin accounts \\n     Debt investment securities \\n     Derivative financial instruments \\n     Loans \\n     Deferred income \\n     Impairment losses on loans \\n     Equity investments \\n     Accrued interest receivable      \\n     Other assets \\nTotal \\n\\nLiabilities \\n     Borrowings \\n     Margin accounts \\n     Derivative financial instruments \\n     Other and lease liabilities \\nTotal \\n\\nEuro \\n\\n79,921 \\n30,740 \\n375,444 \\n7,914 \\n1,565,941 \\n(9,724) \\n(38,510) \\n12,588 \\n12,830 \\n13,293 \\n2,050,437 \\n\\n443,098 \\n16,590 \\n29,261 \\n10,300 \\n499,249 \\n\\nUnited \\nStates \\ndollar \\n\\n88,793 \\n- \\n277,004 \\n15,394 \\n703,859 \\n(4,694) \\n(1,574) \\n13,109 \\n8,103 \\n2,168 \\n1,102,162 \\n\\n998,702 \\n- \\n16,608 \\n- \\n1,015,310 \\n\\nSwiss \\nfranc \\n\\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n331 \\n331 \\n\\n339,530 \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n339,530 \\n\\nOther \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n1,461 \\n- \\n- \\n971 \\n74,638 \\n(282) \\n(4,139) \\n80 \\n6,248 \\n162 \\n79,139 \\n\\n493,071 \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n493,071 \\n\\n170,175 \\n30,740 \\n652,448 \\n24,279 \\n2,344,438 \\n(14,700) \\n(44,223) \\n25,777 \\n27,181 \\n15,954 \\n3,232,069 \\n\\n2,274,401 \\n16,590 \\n45,869 \\n10,300 \\n2,347,160 \\n\\nCurrency balance at 31 December 2021 \\n\\n1,551,188 \\n\\n86,852 \\n\\n(339,199) \\n\\n(413,932) \\n\\n884,909 \\n\\nAt 31 December 2020 \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000) \\nAssets \\n     Cash and due from banks \\n     Deposits in margin accounts \\n     Debt investment securities \\n     Derivative financial instruments \\n     Loans \\n     Deferred income \\n     Impairment losses on loans \\n     Equity investments \\n     Accrued interest receivable      \\n     Other assets \\nTotal \\n\\nLiabilities \\n     Borrowings \\n     Margin accounts \\n     Derivative financial instruments \\n     Other and lease liabilities \\nTotal \\n\\nEuro \\n\\n6,507 \\n26,240 \\n485,640 \\n2,667 \\n1,275,916 \\n(9,336) \\n(48,495) \\n10,851 \\n7,596 \\n6,372 \\n1,763,958 \\n\\nUnited \\nStates \\ndollar \\n\\n26,785 \\n- \\n202,321 \\n23,141 \\n562,747 \\n(3,988) \\n(3,083) \\n15,374 \\n9,580 \\n2,308 \\n835,185 \\n\\nSwiss \\nfranc \\n\\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n16 \\n535 \\n551 \\n\\n342,087 \\n22,920 \\n15,812 \\n11,742 \\n392,561 \\n\\n1,042,201 \\n- \\n10,107 \\n- \\n1,052,308 \\n\\n185,697 \\n- \\n- \\n- \\n185,697 \\n\\nOther \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n1,036 \\n- \\n- \\n893 \\n204,258 \\n(489) \\n(4,359) \\n85 \\n6,320 \\n275 \\n208,019 \\n\\n331,729 \\n- \\n3,016 \\n- \\n334,745 \\n\\n34,328 \\n26,240 \\n687,961 \\n26,701 \\n2,042,921 \\n(13,813) \\n(55,937) \\n26,310 \\n23,512 \\n9,490 \\n2,807,713 \\n\\n1,901,714 \\n22,920 \\n28,935 \\n11,742 \\n1,965,311 \\n\\nCurrency balance at 31 December 2020 \\n\\n1,371,397 \\n\\n(217,123) \\n\\n(185,146) \\n\\n(126,726) \\n\\n842,402 \\n\\n43 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nc2. \\n\\nInterest rate risk \\n\\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate, favorably or unfavorably, \\ndue to changes in market interest rates. The length of time for which the rate of interest is determined on \\na financial instrument indicates to what extent it is exposed to that interest rate risk. \\n\\nThe Bank’s interest rate risk management activities aim to enhance profitability, by limiting the effect on \\nasset values of adverse interest rate movements  in  order to increase net  interest income  by managing \\ninterest rate exposure. The majority of the Bank’s loan portfolio is variable interest rate and the Bank has \\na policy aimed at minimizing interest rate mismatches between its assets and liabilities that seeks to ensure \\nthat the interest rate payment periods for its liabilities are matched as closely as possible to interest rate \\npayment periods for the Bank’s assets. As a matter of policy, the Bank does not take discretionary interest \\nrate positions. \\n\\nThe  tables  below  provide  information  of  the  Bank’s  interest  rate  risk  exposure  on  non-trading  financial \\nassets and liabilities.

The \\nBank’s paid-in capital is held in Euro and the Bank’s loan portfolio is typically denominated as 60% \\nEuro,  30%  US  dollar  and  10%  other  local  currencies.  In  addition,  the  Bank’s  administrative \\nexpenses are denominated in Euro, and the Bank’s income is typically denominated as 60% Euro, \\n30% US dollar and 10% other local currency. The Bank has addressed this sensitivity to currency \\nrisk by increasing its percentage of loans denominated in Euro, and therefore increasing its Euro \\ndenominated income. \\n\\nInterest rate sensitivity \\n\\nThe Bank’s interest rate sensitivity analysis comprises two elements. Firstly, there is the differential \\nbetween the interest rate the Bank earns on  its assets and the cost of borrowing to fund these \\nassets. For this element the Bank does, as closely as possible, match interest rate periods, thus \\nminimizing or even eliminating sensitivity. Secondly, there is the absolute rate earned on assets \\nthat are funded by the Bank’s member’s equity resources. The majority of the Bank’s member’s \\nequity  resources  are  currently  invested  in  the  Bank’s  loan  portfolio  at  floating  rates;  therefore, \\nsubjecting earnings on member’s equity resources to a minor degree of fluctuation. \\n\\nThe table below details the re-pricing gap by currency.

The Bank hedges interest \\nrate risk to the extent of the benchmark interest rate exposure of the floating leg (mainly Euribor, \\nUSD  Libor).  Provided  that  the  aforementioned  exposures  satisfy  the  hedge  accounting  criteria \\n(please see Note 3.9.1), these are designated in fair value hedges. \\n\\nUpon designation,  the fair  value change  on  the qualifying  hedging  instruments  is recognized  in \\nprofit or loss. Also, the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is \\nrecognized in the same line item in profit or loss. If the carrying amount of the hedged item is not \\nalready measured at fair value (measured at cost or amortized cost), then it is adjusted accordingly, \\nwith a corresponding entry. The Bank recognizes any ineffective portion of the fair value hedge \\nrelationships  in  profit  and  loss  under  the  “Unrealized  net  fair  value  gains  (losses)  on  derivative \\ninstruments” line item. \\n\\nUpon  hedge  discontinuation,  any  hedging  adjustment  made  to  a  hedged  item  for  which  the \\neffective interest method is used, is amortized to profit or loss, by adjusting the effective interest \\nrate  from  the  date  on  which  amortization  begins.  If  the  hedged  item  is  derecognized,  then  the \\nadjustment is recognized immediately in profit or loss. \\n\\nThe Bank establishes a hedge ratio 1:1, by aligning the par amount of the fixed-rate liability and \\nthe  notional  amount  of  the  interest  rate  and  cross  currency  swap  designated  as  a  hedging \\ninstrument. Note 3.9.1 sets out more details on the accounting policy of the fair value hedges. \\n\\nAt  31  December  2021,  the  Bank  held  the  following  interest  rate  and  cross  currency  swaps  as \\nhedging instruments in fair value hedges of interest and foreign currency risk (2020: nil): \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000) \\n\\nInterest Rate Swaps \\n\\nHedge of borrowings/euro notes: \\nNominal amount  \\nAverage fixed interest rate \\n\\nCross Currency Swaps \\n\\nHedge of borrowings/other notes: \\nNominal amount \\n\\nAverage EUR:AUD exchange rate \\nAverage EUR:PLN exchange rate \\n\\nAt 31 December 2021 \\n\\n1–5 years \\n\\nOver 5 years \\n\\n                 120,000  \\n1.44% \\n\\n                   15,847  \\n\\n                   19,330  \\n                       1.56  \\n\\n                      4.60  \\n\\nAverage fixed interest rate \\n\\n2.12% \\n\\n2.91% \\n\\n46 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nThe amounts relating to items designated as hedging instruments and hedge ineffectiveness at 31 \\nDecember 2021 were as follows (2020: nil): \\n\\n Presented in EUR (000) \\n\\nAt 31 December 2021 \\n\\nNominal \\namount \\n\\nCarrying amount \\n\\nAssets  Liabilities \\n\\nLine item in the \\nstatement of \\nfinancial position \\nwhere the hedging \\ninstrument is \\nincluded \\n\\nChange in fair \\nvalue used for \\ncalculating \\nhedge \\nineffectiveness \\nfor 2021 \\n\\nIneffectiveness \\nrecognized in \\nprofit or loss \\n\\nLine item in \\nprofit or loss \\nthat includes \\nhedge \\nineffectiveness \\n\\nInterest rate swaps – \\nhedge of borrowings \\n\\n120,000  \\n\\n-    \\n\\n6,118  \\n\\nCross currency swaps – \\nhedge of borrowings \\n\\n35,178  \\n\\n-    \\n\\n3,177  \\n\\nDerivative \\nfinancial \\ninstruments – \\nliabilities \\n\\nDerivative \\nfinancial \\ninstruments – \\nliabilities \\n\\n(6,118) \\n\\n(471) \\n\\n(3,177) \\n\\n1,389  \\n\\nNet fair value \\ngains (losses) \\non derivative \\ninstruments \\n\\nNet fair value \\ngains (losses) \\non derivative \\ninstruments \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n155,178  \\n\\n-    \\n\\n9,294  \\n\\n(9,294) \\n\\n918  \\n\\nThe amounts relating to items designated as hedged items at 31 December 2021 were as follows \\n(2020: nil): \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000)                                                   At 31 December 2021 \\n\\nCarrying amount \\n\\nLine item in the \\nstatement of financial \\nposition in which the \\nhedged item is included \\n\\nChange in value used \\nfor calculating hedge \\nineffectiveness \\n\\nAssets \\n\\nLiabilities \\n\\nEuro Notes issued \\n\\n-    \\n\\n114,353  \\n\\nBorrowings \\n\\nOther Notes Issued \\n\\n-    \\n\\n30,612  \\n\\nBorrowings \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n-    \\n\\n144,965  \\n\\n5,647  \\n\\n4,566  \\n\\n10,213  \\n\\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2021, there were no amounts related to settled swaps. \\n\\nCash flow hedges \\n\\nAs  part  of  the  risk  management  strategy  objective,  the  Bank  also  uses  pay  fixed/receive  fixed \\ncross-currency interest rate swaps, in order to hedge the exposure to the variability in cash flows \\nattributable to interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk in respect to its issuance of fixed rate \\nnotes denominated in foreign currencies (e.g. CHF).

Note 3.9.1 sets out more details on the accounting policy of the cash flow hedges. \\n\\nAt 31 December 2021, the Bank designated a pay fixed-receive fixed cross-currency interest rate \\nswap (USD:CHF) in cash flow hedge relationship. The hedging instrument’s nominal amount was \\nEUR 143,177 thousand, with the corresponding hedged item being Swiss franc notes issued, as \\nincluded in the Bank’s statement of financial position (under “Borrowings” line item).  \\n\\nFor this outstanding hedged designation, the balance in the cash flow hedge reserve amounts to \\nEUR 493 thousand loss (2020: nil) (see Note 24). \\n\\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2021, there were no amounts related to settled swaps. \\n\\nC5. \\n\\nEquity price risk \\n\\nThe  Bank  has  a  small  equity  investments  portfolio  and  as  such  does  not  have  significant  market  risk \\nexposure  concerning  foreign  exchange  or  equity  price  risk  on  this  portfolio.  At  31  December  2021  the \\nBank’s equity investments are classified at FVTOCI, except for one, and are primarily unlisted. \\n\\nThe Bank takes a long-term approach of its equity investments and has no intention of exiting from any, \\ntherefore accepts the short-term volatilities in value from exchange rate and price risk. The Bank expects \\nthe effect on net income to be of little to no impact. \\n\\nAdditional sensitivity information for the Bank’s  equity  investments has been  included under  ‘Fair value \\nhierarchy’ later in this section and in the Note “Equity investments”. \\n\\nOperational Risk \\n\\nLike  all  financial  institutions,  the  Bank  is  exposed  to  operational  risks  arising  from  its  systems  and \\nprocesses.  Operational  risks  include  the  risks  of  losses  resulting  from  inadequate  or  failed  internal \\nprocesses,  people,  systems,  legal,  and  from  external  events  which  could  have  a  negative  financial  or \\nadverse reputational impact. The Bank has a low tolerance for losses arising from the operational risks the \\nBank is exposed to. \\n\\nThe Compliance and Operational Risk Management Department (DCR) has oversight on operational risk \\nactivities across the Bank. The Bank’s operational risk framework is a network of processes, procedures, \\nreports and responsibilities that are used to identify, manage and monitor the operational risks of the Bank. \\nThese include committees, working groups, day-to-day practices such as the collection and analysis of key \\nrisks,  risk  of  loss  incidents  and  both  strategic  and  work  cultural  practices.  This  provides  a  structured \\napproach  to  managing  operational  risk  and  seeks  to  apply  consistent  standards  and  techniques  for \\nevaluating  risks  across  the  Bank.  The  Bank  has  a  comprehensive  set  of  policies  and  procedures  that \\nindicate how operational risks should be managed throughout the Bank.  \\n\\nThe sources of operational risk emerge  in various ways, including business  interruptions,  inappropriate \\nbehavior of employees (including fraud), failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or failure of \\nvendors  to  perform  in  accordance  with  their  contractual  arrangements.  These  events  could  result  in \\nfinancial losses, as well as reputational damages to the Bank.  The Bank’s operational risk management \\nfocuses on proactive measures to mitigate the operational risk. \\n\\nWhere any incident may occur the Bank systematically collects, analyses and reports data on that incident \\nto ensure the Bank understands the reasons it occurred and how controls can be improved to reduce or \\nbetter avoid the risk of any future incident. \\n\\n48 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nThe  Bank’s  risk  and  control  assessments  of  the  key  operational  risks  in  each  business  area  are \\ncomprehensive and primarily bottom-up. They are based on  Bank-wide operational risk definitions, that \\nclassify risks under a standardize approach, cover the inherent risks of each business  area and control \\nfunction,  provide  an  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  controls  in  place  to  mitigate  these  risks, \\ndetermine the residual risk ratings and require a decision to either accept or remediate any remaining risk. \\n\\nConcerning cyber crime, which is risk of loss or damage to the Bank’s business areas and customers as a \\nresult  of actions committed or facilitated  through  the  use of networked information systems, the Bank’s \\nInformation Technologies Department (DIT), and information security policies and procedures ensure that \\nall  servers  and  computers  have  up  to  date  antivirus  software.  Backups  are  made  regularly  and  regular \\naccess control checks, system penetration and vulnerability tests along with disaster recovery tests are \\nperformed. \\n\\nThe Bank’s anti-cyber attack controls are checked and aligned with industry best practice by the DIT. \\n\\nThe  Bank  regularly  produces  management  information  reports  covering  the  key  inputs  and  outputs  of \\noperational risk. These reports are used to monitor outcomes against agreed targets and tolerance levels. \\nThe  Bank  utilizes  the  Bank’s  IT  systems  and  other  information  tools  to  ensure  operational  risks  are \\nidentified and managed properly. \\n\\nOverall,  the  Bank  is  committed  to  follow  the  best  practices  and  market  standards  in  the  area  of \\naccountability, transparency and business ethics. Due diligence on customers and counterparties take into \\nconsideration  the  Anti-Fraud  Corruption  and  Monetary  Laundering  Policy  and  Know-Your  Customer \\nProcedures. The Bank also has a contingency and business continuity plans, and a disaster recovery off-\\nsite which aims to ensure the continuity of its operations and protect the interests of all the key stakeholders \\nof the Bank, namely, the member countries, bondholders and other creditors as well as employees and \\ntheir families, in the event of any disturbance in office locations. \\n\\nFair Value Hierarchy \\n\\nFor  the  above  financial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value,  the  Bank  uses  the  following  hierarchy  for \\ndetermining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\n• \\n\\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; \\n\\nLevel 2: Other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair \\n\\n value are observable, either directly or indirectly; and \\n\\nLevel 3: Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value \\n\\n that are not based on observable market data. \\n\\nThe tables below identify the Bank’s financial instruments measured at fair value. \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000) \\nDerivative financial instruments – assets \\nFair value through profit or loss: \\n     Loans \\n     Equity investments \\nFair value through other comprehensive income: \\n     Debt investment securities \\n     Equity investments \\nDerivative financial instruments – liabilities \\nAt 31 December 2021 \\n\\nLevel 1 \\n- \\n\\nLevel 2 \\n24,279 \\n\\n- \\n- \\n\\n652,448 \\n- \\n- \\n652,448 \\n\\n- \\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n(45,869) \\n(21,590) \\n\\nLevel 3 \\n- \\n\\n15,014 \\n791 \\n\\n- \\n24,986 \\n- \\n40,791 \\n\\nCarrying \\nAmount \\n24,279 \\n\\n15,014 \\n791 \\n\\n652,448 \\n24,986 \\n(45,869) \\n671,649 \\n\\nThere have been no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year.

In December 2007 the BoG approved an increase of the Bank’s authorized share \\ncapital  to  SDR  3  billion  and  authorized  the  offering  of  SDR  1  billion  to  the  existing  Member  States  for \\nsubscription, with the objective of increasing subscribed capital to a total of SDR 2 billion. The increase \\nallows the Bank to implement its operational strategy to a substantial degree. The Bank does not have any \\nother classes of capital. \\n\\n51 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nIn October 2008 the above new shares in the amount of SDR 1 billion that were offered for subscription to \\nthe  Bank’s  Member  States  were  fully  subscribed  and  allocated.  Accordingly,  the  Bank’s  paid-in  share \\ncapital was doubled from SDR 300 million to SDR 600 million. The remaining SDR 1 billion of authorized \\nshare capital has not yet been allocated. \\n\\nPursuant to Resolution 131 of the BoG, that unanimously adopted the first amendment to the Establishing \\nAgreement, which became effective on 21 June 2013. As of this effective date, and as per Resolution 131 \\nof the BoG, the unit of account of the Bank became the EUR and all of the Bank’s authorized share capital \\nwas redenominated from SDR to EUR. The conversion rate applied was SDR to EUR fixed at 1:1.15. \\n\\nThe share capital usage of the Bank is guided by statutory and financial policy parameters. Article 15 of \\nthe  Establishing  Agreement  limits  the  total  amount  of  outstanding  loans,  equity  investments  and \\nguarantees made for ordinary operations to 150% of the Bank’s unimpaired subscribed capital, reserves \\nand surpluses, establishing a 1.5:1 institutional gearing ratio. Additionally, disbursed equity investments \\nshall  not  at  any  time  exceed  an  amount  corresponding  to  the  Bank’s  total  unimpaired  paid-in  capital, \\nsurpluses and general reserve. \\n\\nThe  Bank  determines  required  share  capital  as  the  potential  losses  the  Bank  may  incur  based  on \\nprobabilities consistent with the Bank’s credit rating. The main risk categories assessed under the share \\ncapital  adequacy  framework  are  credit  risk,  market  risk  and  operational  risk,  and  such  total  risks  are \\nmanaged within the available share capital base that excludes callable share capital, while maintaining a \\nprudent cushion. A main objective of this framework is to manage the Bank’s share capital by providing a \\nconsistent measurement of capital headroom over time. The Bank has no expectation for callable share \\ncapital to be called, and will prevent this need and use only available risk share capital as reserves, surplus \\nand paid-in. \\n\\nAt  the  36th  meeting  of  the  BoD  in  2008,  the  operational  gearing  ratio  was  set  at  100%  of  the  Bank’s \\nunimpaired paid-up capital, reserves and surpluses, and the usable portion of the callable capital. This limit \\non the total amount of operations which includes all callable capital is approximately EUR 2.6 billion. \\n\\nOverall, the Bank preserves an actively managed capital stock to prudently cover risks in its activities. As \\na multilateral financial institution, the Bank is not subject to regulatory capital requirements. However, the \\nBank uses standards proposed by the Basel II Capital Accord as a benchmark for its risk management and \\ncapital framework. Pursuant to Article 5 of the Establishing Agreement, the BoG shall at intervals of not \\nmore than five years review the capital stock of the Bank. In substance, the primary objective of the Bank’s \\ncapital management is to ensure adequate share capital is available to support the Bank’s operations. \\n\\n52 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n6. \\n\\nOPERATING SEGMENTS \\n\\nThe  Bank  is  a  multilateral  financial  institution,  which  in  accordance  with  the  Establishing  Agreement,  is \\ndedicated  to  accelerating  development  and  promoting  co-operation  among  the  Bank’s  shareholder \\ncountries. The Bank operates in a specific geographical area and the primary reporting format for business \\nsegments are the Lending and Treasury operations. Lending activities represent investments in projects \\nsuch  as  loans,  equity  investments  and  guarantees.  Treasury  activities  include  raising  debt  finance, \\ninvesting surplus liquidity, and managing the Bank’s foreign exchange, liquidity and interest rate risks. \\n\\nThe Bank’s primary source of revenues is interest income from above mentioned activities. In addition, the \\nBank  also  derives  revenues  from  net  fees  and  commissions  and  other  income  that  comprise:  dividend \\nincome, net  gains from equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, net  gains from loans,  net \\ngains from investment securities held at amortized cost and at fair value through profit or loss, and other \\nincome. \\n\\nInformation  on  the  financial  performance  of  Lending  and  Treasury  activities  is  prepared  regularly  and \\nprovided to the President, the Bank’s chief operating decision-maker. As such, these activities have been \\nidentified  as  the  operating  segments  which  the  President  assesses  their  performance  in  a  manner \\nassociated with the financial statements and consistent with the prior year that is as follows: \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000) \\n\\nLending \\n\\nTreasury \\n\\nTotal \\n\\nLending \\n\\nTreasury \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n2021 \\n\\n2020 \\n\\nIncome statement \\n\\nInterest income \\nNet fees and commissions \\nOther income \\nTotal segment revenues \\nInterest expense \\nNet interest income (expense) on derivatives \\nGains (losses) on other financial instruments \\nForeign exchange \\nPersonnel and administrative expenses \\nDepreciation and amortization \\nSegment income before impairment \\nLess: impairment / fair value (losses) \\nIncome for the year \\n\\n97,702 \\n1,971 \\n178 \\n99,851 \\n(57,491) \\n- \\n683 \\n- \\n(19,312) \\n(466) \\n23,265 \\n11,882 \\n35,147 \\n\\n7,469 \\n- \\n4,855 \\n12,324 \\n(1,001) \\n13,799 \\n(16,602) \\n(559) \\n(1,614) \\n(12) \\n6,335 \\n2,415 \\n8,750 \\n\\n105,171 \\n1,971 \\n5,033 \\n112,175 \\n(58,492) \\n13,799 \\n(15,919) \\n(559) \\n(20,926) \\n(478) \\n29,600 \\n14,297 \\n43,897 \\n\\n88,338 \\n2,040 \\n444 \\n90,822 \\n(60,442) \\n- \\n7,174 \\n- \\n(18,697) \\n(515) \\n18,342 \\n(12,894) \\n5,448 \\n\\n9,518 \\n- \\n(1,752) \\n7,766 \\n(606) \\n7,427 \\n(2,049) \\n78 \\n(1,561) \\n(10) \\n11,045 \\n(2,278) \\n8,767 \\n\\n97,856 \\n2,040 \\n(1,308) \\n98,588 \\n(61,048) \\n7,427 \\n5,125 \\n78 \\n(20,258) \\n(525) \\n29,387 \\n(15,172) \\n14,215 \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000) \\n\\nLending \\n\\nTreasury \\n\\nTotal \\n\\nLending \\n\\nTreasury \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n31 December 2021 \\n\\n31 December 2020 \\n\\nFinancial position \\n\\nSegment assets \\nAt end of year \\n\\nSegment liabilities \\nMembers’ equity \\nAt end of year \\n\\n2,355,240 \\n\\n877,642  3,232,882 \\n  3,232,882 \\n\\n  2,033,789 \\n\\n775,230  2,809,019 \\n  2,809,019 \\n\\n2,284,701 \\n- \\n\\n2,347,160 \\n62,459 \\n- \\n885,722 \\n  3,232,882 \\n\\n1,913,456\\n- \\n\\n1,965,311 \\n51,855 \\n- \\n843,708 \\n  2,809,019 \\n\\n53 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nSegment Revenues – Geographic \\n\\nThe Bank’s revenues arise from the following areas.

The decrease in Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is mainly attributed to the stabilization of \\nthe  Covid-19  pandemic,  driven  by  modest  improvements  of  macroeconomic  variables  used  for  some \\nmember countries as their economies bounced back from the Covid-19 pandemic. The increase amount \\nin Stage 3 is due to the deterioration of a few loans reducing their carrying amount. \\n\\nIn 2019 the Bank purchased a portion of a loan in deep discount an amount of EUR 8,278 thousand which \\npaid EUR 2,097 thousand and credited an impairment loss of EUR 6,181 thousand recognized in stage 3 \\nrather than purchased credit impaired, as the loan agreement on the portion purchased specified that the \\ncontractual obligations would be identical as that of the Bank’s. \\n\\nStaging Criteria 12-month ECL (Stage 1) \\n\\nAs  IFRS  9  does  not  distinguish  between  individually  significant  or  not  individually  significant  financial \\ninstruments, the Bank measures potential credit losses for all non-impaired operations (Stage 1 and Stage \\n2)  on  an  individual  operation  basis.  Provisions  for  impairment  in  Stage  1  are  therefore  affected  by  the \\nspecifics of any particular  operation together with general market scenarios. They are  meant to  protect \\nagainst  potential  risks  that  are  considered  present,  or  within  a  12-month  horizon,  and  derived  from \\npotentially adverse developments in operating conditions beyond the control of individual borrowers. \\n\\nStaging Criteria Lifetime ECL (Stages 2 and 3) \\n\\nWhen an operation deteriorates substantially in credit quality, it enters Stage 2 and an expected credit loss \\ncalculation is performed on a Lifetime Expected Credit Loss (LECL) basis. Stage 2 operations are those \\nthat have experienced an overall credit quality downgrade but are still performing. They are not considered \\ncredit-impaired. \\n\\nStage 3 operations have objective evidence of impairment that immediately impacts the ECL. \\n\\n56 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nRevolving Facilities and Undrawn Commitments \\n\\nRevolving credit facilities have no fixed term and they can be cancelled at the discretion of the Bank at any \\npoint in time. These facilities are subject to, at a minimum, an annual credit review. In this regard, the date \\nof the latest credit review is considered the relevant date to assess if there is any increase in credit risk, as \\nat that point in time. Following this, the Bank may amend the terms and conditions of the exposure. \\n\\nThe  estimate  of  the  ECLs  on  irrevocable  loan  commitments  is  consistent  with  its  expectations  of \\ndrawdowns on that loan commitment.  Therefore, the Bank considered (i) the expected portion of the loan \\ncommitment that will be drawn down  within 12 months of the reporting date when estimating 12-month \\nexpected credit losses and (ii) the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over \\nthe expected life of the reporting date when estimating lifetime expected credit losses.  At 31 December \\n2021 the amount of expected credit losses was EUR 193 thousand for loan commitments of EUR 208,203 \\nthousand (2020: EUR 983 thousand for loan commitments of EUR 245,143 thousand). \\n\\n13.  \\n\\nDEBT INVESTMENT SECURITIES \\n\\nDebt investment securities are analyzed as follows: \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000) \\nBonds \\nCommercial papers \\nDebt investment securities \\n\\nAt \\n31 December \\n2021 \\n136,132 \\n516,316 \\n652,448 \\n\\nAt \\n31 December \\n2020 \\n291,179 \\n396,782 \\n687,961 \\n\\n57 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n14.  \\n\\nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\n\\nThe table below shows the Bank’s outstanding derivative financial instruments.  \\n\\nThe first column shows the sum of notional amounts, which is the amount of a derivative’s nominal value,  \\nwhereas the second and third columns depict the fair value of the outstanding derivatives. \\n\\n Presented in EUR (000) \\n\\nAt 31 December 2021 \\n\\nNotional amount \\nof derivative \\ncontracts \\n\\nFair Value \\n\\nAssets \\n\\nLiabilities  \\n\\nDerivatives held for hedging: \\nDerivatives designated and effective \\nas hedging instruments carried at fair \\nvalue hedges: \\nInterest Rate Swaps \\n\\nCross Currency Swaps \\n\\nTotal Derivatives designated in fair \\nvalue hedges: \\n\\nDerivatives designated and effective \\nas hedging instruments in cash flow \\nhedges: \\nCross Currency Swaps \\n\\nTotal Derivatives designated in cash \\nflow hedges: \\n\\nDerivatives held for risk management \\npurposes- not designated in hedging \\nrelationships: \\nInterest Rate Swaps \\n\\nCross Currency Swaps \\n\\nForwards \\n\\nCap/floor \\n\\nTotal Derivatives held for risk \\nmanagement purposes- not \\ndesignated in hedging relationships: \\n\\n120,000 \\n\\n35,178 \\n\\n155,178 \\n\\n143,177 \\n\\n143,177 \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n231 \\n\\n231 \\n\\n(6,118) \\n\\n(3,177) \\n\\n(9,294) \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n379,263 \\n\\n1,061,402 \\n\\n- \\n\\n160,000 \\n\\n15 \\n\\n23,934 \\n\\n- \\n\\n99 \\n\\n(16,969) \\n\\n(19,606) \\n\\n- \\n\\n- \\n\\n1,600,665 \\n\\n24,049 \\n\\n(36,575) \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n1,899,019 \\n\\n24,279 \\n\\n(45,869) \\n\\n58 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000)  \\n\\nAt 31 December 2020 \\n\\nNotional amount \\nof derivative \\ncontracts \\n\\nFair Value \\n\\nAssets \\n\\nLiabilities  \\n\\nDerivatives held for hedging: \\nDerivatives designated and effective \\nas hedging instruments carried at \\nfair value hedges: \\n\\nInterest Rate Swaps \\n\\nCross Currency Swaps \\n\\nTotal Derivatives designated in fair \\nvalue hedges: \\n\\nDerivatives designated and effective \\nas hedging instruments in cash flow \\nhedges: \\n\\nCross Currency Swaps \\n\\nTotal Derivatives designated in cash \\nflow hedges: \\n\\nDerivatives held for risk \\nmanagement purposes- not \\ndesignated in hedging relationships: \\n\\n-    \\n\\n-    \\n\\n-    \\n\\n-    \\n\\n-    \\n\\n-                                   -    \\n\\n-                                   -    \\n\\n-                                   -    \\n\\n-                                   -    \\n\\n-                                   -    \\n\\nInterest Rate Swaps \\n\\n801,225  \\n\\n1,625  \\n\\nCross Currency Swaps \\n\\n902,619  \\n\\n23,499  \\n\\nForwards \\n\\nCap/floor \\n\\nTotal Derivatives held for risk \\nmanagement purposes- not \\ndesignated in hedging relationships: \\n\\n83,433  \\n\\n1,577  \\n\\n160,000  \\n\\n-                                   -    \\n\\n1,947,277  \\n\\n26,701  \\n\\n(28,935) \\n\\n(11,548) \\n\\n(16,397) \\n\\n(990) \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n1,947,277  \\n\\n26,701  \\n\\n(28,935) \\n\\nThe  Bank  enters  into  derivatives  for  risk  management  purposes  and  contains  derivatives  which  are \\ndesignated as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge relationships, more details of which are provided in \\nNote 5.

The  techniques  applied  to \\nperform these valuations include equity calculations based on EBITDA and market data. \\n\\nDuring the year the Bank had realized a net income of EUR 182 thousand from its investment in the Balkan \\nAccession Fund. \\n\\nOn disposal or exit of an equity investment for those at fair value through other comprehensive income, \\nthe cumulative gain or loss is realized with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized gain or loss that was \\nrecorded prior to the exit from that investment, and is not recycled to the income statement. \\n\\nAs  of  31  December  2021  the  Bank  has  a  committed  amount  of  EUR  6,833  thousand  towards  further \\nparticipation in the above entities.  Further analysis of the equity  investment portfolio is presented in the \\nNote “Risk management”. \\n\\nAs of 31 December 2021 the Bank has few equity investments where it holds slightly more than 20 per \\ncent of the investee share capital, but does not exert significant influence, hence the investments are not \\naccounted for as an investment in an associate under IAS 28. \\n\\n61 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n17. \\n\\nOTHER ASSETS \\n\\nOther assets is analyzed as follows: \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000) \\nAdvances and prepaid expenses \\nAccrued interest on derivatives \\nOther prepayments \\nOther financial assets \\nGuarantee deposits and non-current \\nOther assets \\n\\n18. \\n\\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT \\n\\nProperty and equipment is analyzed as follows: \\n\\nAt \\n31 December \\n2021 \\n3,508 \\n7,259 \\n187 \\n4,930 \\n70 \\n15,954 \\n\\nAt \\n31 December \\n2020 \\n4,068 \\n- \\n187 \\n5,160 \\n75 \\n9,490 \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000) \\n\\nCost \\n\\nAt 31 December 2019 \\nAdditions \\nDisposals \\nAt 31 December 2020 \\nAdditions \\nDisposals \\nAt 31 December 2021 \\n\\nAccumulated depreciation \\n\\nAt 31 December 2019 \\nCharges \\nDisposals \\nAt 31 December 2020 \\nCharges \\nDisposals \\nAt 31 December 2021 \\n\\nNet book value \\n\\nAt 31 December 2021 \\nAt 31 December 2020 \\nAt 31 December 2019 \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n3,410 \\n211 \\n- \\n3,621 \\n188 \\n(29) \\n3,780 \\n\\n2,921 \\n271 \\n- \\n3,192 \\n249 \\n(29) \\n3,412 \\n\\n368 \\n429 \\n489 \\n\\nBuildings \\n(leasehold) \\n\\nVehicle \\n\\nFurniture \\nand office \\naccessories \\n\\nComputers \\nand office \\nequipment \\n\\n603 \\n40 \\n- \\n643 \\n12 \\n(5) \\n650 \\n\\n521 \\n40 \\n- \\n561 \\n29 \\n(5) \\n585 \\n\\n65 \\n82 \\n82 \\n\\n1,775 \\n168 \\n- \\n1,943 \\n154 \\n(24) \\n2,073 \\n\\n1,463 \\n186 \\n- \\n1,649 \\n189 \\n(24) \\n1,814 \\n\\n259 \\n294 \\n312 \\n\\n882 \\n3 \\n- \\n885 \\n22 \\n- \\n907 \\n\\n859 \\n15 \\n- \\n874 \\n13 \\n- \\n887 \\n\\n20 \\n11 \\n23 \\n\\n150 \\n- \\n- \\n150 \\n- \\n- \\n150 \\n\\n78 \\n30 \\n- \\n108 \\n18 \\n- \\n126 \\n\\n24 \\n42 \\n72 \\n\\n62 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n19.  \\n\\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS \\n\\nIntangible assets comprising computer software is analyzed as follows: \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000) \\n\\nCost \\n\\nAt 31 December 2019 \\nAdditions \\nAt 31 December 2020 \\nAdditions \\nAt 31 December 2021 \\n\\nAccumulated amortization \\n\\nAt 31 December 2019 \\nCharges \\nAt 31 December 2020 \\nAdditions \\nAt 31 December 2021 \\n\\nNet book value \\n\\nAt 31 December 2021 \\nAt 31 December 2020 \\nAt 31 December 2019 \\n\\nTotal \\n\\n4,642 \\n130 \\n4,772 \\n132 \\n4,904 \\n\\n4,220 \\n254 \\n4,474 \\n230 \\n4,704 \\n\\n200 \\n298 \\n422 \\n\\n63 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n20. \\n\\nBORROWINGS \\n\\nBorrowing facilities and bond issues debt evidenced by certificates, arranged as at the financial position \\ndate, are analyzed below.

There are no other commitments at end of year arising from non-\\ncancellable lease contract. On adoption of IFRS 16 the impact in the statement of financial position of the \\nrecognition of right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, together with the movement for the year, \\nis analyzed as follows: \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000) \\nLease liability due to initial application of IFRS 16 at 1 January 2019 \\nPrepayment of rental \\nInterest expense on the lease liability \\nLease payments recognized in administrative expenses \\nLease liability at 31 December 2019 \\nLease payments recognized in administrative expenses \\nLease liability at 31 December 2020 \\nRenewal of lease term \\nLess payments recognized in administrative expenses \\nLease liability at 31 December 2021 \\n\\nTotal \\n1,931 \\n(196) \\n- \\n(676) \\n1,059 \\n(676) \\n383 \\n349 \\n(689) \\n43 \\n\\nIFRS 16 indicates that at the commencement date, the lessee (the Bank) will discount the lease payment \\nusing (a) the interest rate implicit in the lease or (b) the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate if the interest \\nrate implicit in the lease cannot be determined. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that \\na lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds to obtain (i) an asset of a similar value to the underlying \\nasset (ii) over a similar term (iii) with similar security (iv) in a similar economic environment. As the Bank \\nhas only one lease arrangement that is nearing maturity, Management concluded that any adjustment or \\nany subsequent interest does not have a material impact on the financial statements. \\n\\nThe  Bank  presents  right-of-use  assets  separately  as  property  and  equipment,  and  the  lease  liability \\nseparately within payables and accrued interest, in the statement of financial position. Consequently, the \\nBank recognizes lease payments and interest, if any on the lease liability on a straight-line basis over the \\nperiod of the lease term, similarly to any benefits received or that are receivable, in the income statement. \\nWhen a lease is terminated before the lease period has expired, any payments required to be made to the \\nlessor, by way of penalty, are recognized as an expense in the period the termination takes place. \\n\\n65 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n23. \\n\\nSHARE CAPITAL \\n\\nFrom  the  Bank’s  inception,  and  in  accordance  with  Article  4  of  the  Establishing  Agreement,  the  Bank \\ndenominated its authorized share capital in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) as defined by the International \\nMonetary  Fund  (IMF).  Resolution  131  of  the  BoG  unanimously  adopted  the  requisite  amendments  to \\nparagraph 1 of Article 4 and Articles 23 and 24 of the Establishing Agreement, to expressly include among \\nthe exclusive powers of the BoG the change of the unit of account of the Bank, and the redenomination of \\nall capital stock of the Bank. These amendments to the Establishing Agreement became effective on 21 \\nJune 2013 (the ‘Effective Date’). In accordance with such Resolution 131 of the BoG as of the Effective \\nDate the unit of account of the Bank became the EUR and the authorized capital stock of the Bank was \\nredenominated  into  three  billion  four  hundred  and  fifty  million  EUR  (3,450,000,000),  divided  into  three \\nmillion  (3,000,000)  shares  having  a  par  value  of  one  thousand  and  one  hundred  and  fifty  EUR  (1,150) \\neach,  inclusive  of  all  subscribed  and  unallocated  shares.  Accordingly,  as  of  the  Effective  Date,  all \\noutstanding share capital commitments of participating members in respect of their subscribed shares were \\nconverted into EUR. \\n\\nThe authorized capital stock of the Bank may be increased at such time and under such terms as may \\nseem advisable. \\n\\nThe Bank’s capital stock is divided into paid-in shares (fully paid and payable in installments) and callable \\nshares. Payment for the paid-in shares subscribed to by members was made over a period of years in \\naccordance with Article 6 of the Establishing Agreement for the initial capital raising purpose of the Bank, \\nand as determined in advance by the Bank for capital increases (in the only capital increase of the Bank \\nso far, the structure of payments specified was similar to the one in Article 6). The same Article states that \\npayment of the amount subscribed to in respect of the callable shares is subject to call only as and when \\nrequired by the Bank to meet its obligations. \\n\\nUnder Article 37 of the Establishing Agreement any member may withdraw from the Bank by transmitting \\na notice in writing to the Bank at its Headquarters. Withdrawal by a member shall become effective and its \\nmembership shall cease on the date specified in its notice, but in no event less than six months after such \\nnotice is received by the Bank. However, at any time before the withdrawal becomes finally effective, the \\nmember may notify the Bank in writing of the cancellation of its notice of intention to withdraw. Under Article \\n39 of the Establishing Agreement after the date on which a member ceases membership, it shall remain \\nliable for its direct obligations to the Bank, and also remain responsible for its contingent liabilities to the \\nBank, incurred as of that date. No member has ever withdrawn its membership, nor has any ever indicated \\nto  the  Bank  it  might  do  so.  Were  a  member  to  withdraw  from  the  Bank,  at  the  time  a  member  ceases \\nmembership, the Bank shall arrange for the repurchase of such a member’s shares by the Bank as part of \\nthe settlement of accounts with such a member, and be able to impose conditions and set dates pursuant \\nto the same Article 39 of the Establishing Agreement. Any amount due to the member for its shares shall \\nbe  withheld  so  long  as  the  member,  including  its  central  bank  or  any  of  its  agencies,  has  outstanding \\nobligations to the Bank, which may, at the option of the Bank, be applied to any such liability as it matures. \\n\\nIf losses are sustained by the Bank on any guarantees or loans which were outstanding on the date when \\na  member  ceased  membership  and  the  amount  of  such  losses  exceeds  the  amount  of  the  reserves \\nprovided against losses on the date, the member concerned shall repay, upon demand, the amount by \\nwhich the repurchase price of its shares would have been reduced if the losses had been taken into account \\nwhen the repurchase price was determined. \\n\\nUnder Article 42 of the Establishing Agreement in the event of termination of the operations of the Bank, \\nthe liability of members for the unpaid portion of the subscribed capital of the Bank shall continue until all \\nclaims of creditors, including all contingent claims, have been discharged. \\n\\nAll  participating  members  had  fully  subscribed  to  the  initial  authorized  share  capital  in  accordance  with \\nArticle  5  of  the  Establishing  Agreement.  Subsequently,  at  the  Sixth  Annual  Meeting  of  the  Board  of \\nGovernors held on 6 June 2004 three Member States, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova requested a 50% \\nreduction of their portion of subscribed capital, from 2% to 1% of the initial authorized capital and the BoG \\napproved their request. On 5 October 2008 the new shares pursuant to the capital increase of the Bank \\nwere offered in the same structure as the initial authorized share capital, in the amount of EUR 1.15 billion, \\nand were fully subscribed by the Member States. \\n\\n66 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\nFurthermore,  Azerbaijan  also  subscribed  to  the  3%  of  the  initial  authorized  share  capital  that  remained \\nunallocated,  after  the  above  mentioned  participation  reduction,  while  Romania  subscribed  both  to  their \\nallocation of new shares and to those that would have been allocated to Georgia had it chosen to participate \\nin the capital increase. This subscription process followed a decision taken by the BoG in December 2007 \\nto triple the Bank’s authorized capital to EUR 3.45 billion and to double the subscribed capital to EUR 2.3 \\nbillion, while leaving authorized capital of EUR 1.15 billion unallocated. On October 2011 the BoG approved \\nthe request from Moldova for a 50% reduction of its portion of subscribed capital, from 1% to 0.5%, and \\nthose shares were released to unallocated share capital. \\n\\nThe above share capital is analyzed as follows: \\n\\nPresented in EUR (000) \\nAuthorized share capital \\nLess: unallocated share capital* \\nSubscribed share capital \\nLess: shares not yet called \\nPaid-up share capital \\nAdvance against future call \\nPaid-in share capital \\n\\n* \\n\\nShares available to new or existing Member States. \\n\\nInitial Capital \\n\\nAt \\n31 December \\n2021 \\n3,450,000 \\n(1,161,500) \\n2,288,500 \\n(1,601,950) \\n686,550 \\n- \\n686,550 \\n\\nAt \\n31 December \\n2020 \\n3,450,000 \\n(1,161,500) \\n2,288,500 \\n(1,601,950) \\n686,550 \\n- \\n686,550 \\n\\nIn  accordance  with  paragraph  2  under  Article  5  of  the  Establishing  Agreement,  the  initially  authorized \\ncapital stock was subscribed by and issued to each Member as follows: 10% (EUR 115 million) fully paid \\nand 20% (EUR 230 million) payable by promissory notes or other obligations which were not negotiable \\nand non-interest bearing in eight equal successive annual installments in the years 1998 to 2005. \\n\\nCapital Increase \\n\\nThe capital increase of EUR 1.15 billion is divided into EUR 345 million paid in capital and EUR 805 million \\ncallable capital.

Special Funds are audited on \\nan annual basis and their assets and fund balances are not included in the Bank’s statement of financial \\nposition.

Those developments will negatively impact the quality of some of the Bank assets, and are likely \\nto result in a sizeable increase in impairment losses. The losses associated with these developments will \\nbe recognized in the 2022 financial statements and because of the high uncertainty that exists as how the \\nsituation will develop it is not possible currently to reliably estimate those losses. \\n\\nAt  31  December  2021  the  Bank  carried  on  its  statement  of  financial  position  the  following  loan  and \\ninvestment securities: \\n\\n• \\n• \\n\\nUkraine: Loans of EUR 299 million and Debt investment securities of EUR 14 million. \\nRussian Federation: Loans of EUR 485 million and Equities of EUR 1.3 million. \\n\\n At 6 June 2022 there had been no other material events after the reporting period to disclose. \\n\\nOn 6 June 2022 the Board of Directors reviewed the financial statements and authorized them for issue.  \\nThese financial statements will be subsequently submitted for approval to the Board of Governors. \\n\\n73 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cNotes to the Financial Statements \\n\\n29. \\n\\nSUMMARY OF SPECIAL FUNDS \\n\\nWith the Hellenic Government \\n\\nThe Technical Cooperation Special Fund’s objective is to contribute to the economic development of the \\nBlack Sea Region’s Member Countries.
